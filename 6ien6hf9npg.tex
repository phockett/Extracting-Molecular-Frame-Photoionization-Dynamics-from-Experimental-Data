\subsection{Theoretical techniques \& analysis methodologies}

To cover 

\begin{itemize}
\item Theory sophistication and availability
\item Data analysis techniques
\item Development of new formalism/theory, relation to phase retrieval problems, etc.
\end{itemize}

A number of authors have treated MFPADs and related problems, see Appendix XX for some examples [TODO]. Herein, a geometric tensor based formalism is developed, which is close in spirit to the treatments given by Underwood and co-workers [REFS], but further separates various sets of physical parameters into dedicated tensors; this allows for a unified theoretical and numerical treatment, where the latter com
