\subsubsection{Bootstrapping basics: noisy data}

To investigate the effects of noise, fitting was repeated for the same set of data-points, but with increasing amounts of white/pink-noise added.

\subsubsection{Further bootstrapping: sub-sample size \& fiedelity}

In cases with noisy data, and/or where uncertainties in fitted parameters remain large, fitting to larger and/or alternative sub-sets of the data may be pursued.

\subsubsection{Further bootstrapping: information content \& sensitivity}

As well as considering the results from full fits of the data, the inherent sensitivity of various aspects of the problem
