\subsubsection{Bootstrapping basics: noisy data}

To investigate the effects of noise, fitting was repeated for the same set of data-points, but with increasing amounts of white/pink-noise added.

\subsubsection{Further bootstrapping: sub-sample size \& fiedelity}

In cases with noisy data, and/or where uncertainties in fitted parameters remain large, fitting to larger and/or alternative sub-sets of the data may be pursued.

\subsubsection{Further bootstrapping: sub-sample size \& fiedelity}

An obvious route to improvement of the retrieved matrix elements is via the inclusion of additional data points. In the original demonstration \cite{marceau2017MolecularFrameReconstruction}, after an initial 10


\subsubsection{Further bootstrapping: information content \& sensitivity}

As well as considering the results from full fits of the data, the inherent sensitivity of various aspects of the problem can also be investigated. In general, this will depend on the details of the problem at hand (symmetry, ADMs etc.), but can in essence be considered independently of the matrix elements themselves via ``channel functions" or equivalent [WILL BE DISCUSSED ABOVE? ALSO DENSITY MAT?]. In the PEMtk routines, the various component tensors are computed and packaged as a basis set prior to fitting, and can be further examined independently.
