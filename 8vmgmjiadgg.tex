\subsubsection{Bootstrapping basics: MFPADs}

With the matrix elements to hand, the MFPADs can also be computed, for any arbitrary molecular alignment and polarization. Some examples are shown in Fig. [XX]. A number of points are illustrated by the figure:

\begin{itemize}
\item The reference matrix elements produce the MFPADs shown in the top row of the figure, which provide a reference for the fidelity of the reconstructed MFPADs.
\item The 2nd row illustrates the case of the phase-averaged (but not "corrected") parameters. This serves to highlight the sensitivity of the PADs to the relative phases of the matrix elements - here the $x,y$ results show poor agreement with the ref
\end{itemize}

To further investigate the different parameter sets discussed above, which were essentially identical in the AF-$\beta_{L,M}$ comparisons, Fig. [XX] illustrates some MFPADs for these cases too. [TODO - if interesting]
