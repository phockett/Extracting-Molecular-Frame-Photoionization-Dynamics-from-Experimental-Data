\subsubsection{Bootstrapping basics: MFPADs}

With the matrix elements to hand, the MFPADs can also be computed, for any arbitrary molecular alignment and polarization. Some examples are shown in Fig. [XX]. 

To further investigate the different parameter sets discussed above, which were essentially identical in the AF-$\beta_{L,M}$ comparisons, Fig. [XX] illustrates some MFPADs for these cases too. [TODO - if interesting]
