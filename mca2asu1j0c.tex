\begin{table}


\caption{\label{tab:matE}Retrieved values and statistics for (m)agnitudes, (p)hases and "corrected" phases (pc). For each type and parameter the mean result from the fits is given, along with the standard deviation, and a comparison to the (ref)erence computational data, with absolute and percentage differences. Finally, the value of the difference/standard deviation is given as a rough metric for veracity. [TODO update labels and style]}
