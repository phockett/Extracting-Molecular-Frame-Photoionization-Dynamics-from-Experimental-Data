\subsection{Theory literature sample\label{sec:theory-lit}}

A number of authors have developed relevant theory for photoionization problems. Whilst the fundamentals are similar, different formalisms have been derived for various specific cases, or to emphasize particular aspects of the problem. A few notable examples are listed here.

\begin{itemize}
\item Early derivations for atomic PADs \cite{Cherepkov1979,Cooper1968,Cooper1969}
\item Early derivations for molecular (LF)PADs \cite{Tully1968}, rotationally-resolved cases \cite{Buckingham1970}, and optically-active cases \cite{Ritchie1976}
\item Angular momentum transfer in LF and MFPADs \cite{Fano1972} 
\item General MFPAD (``fixed-molecule") derivation \cite{Dill1976}
\item Atomic PADs and spin polarization \cite{Klar1982}
\item Resonant multiphoton PADs \cite{Dixit1983}
\item Molecular orbital continuum decomposition \cite{Park1996}
\item A simple-model description for MFPADs, including $F_{LN}$ function decomposition \cite{Lucchese2004}
\item Matrix element retrieval from time-resolved photoelectron imaging experiments \cite{Suzuki2007}.
\item Time-resolved PADs and dynamics (including molecular alignment) \cite{Underwood2000,Seideman2001,Stolow2008}
\item LF, RF and MFPADs theory and determination (review article) \cite{dowek2012PhotoionizationDynamicsPhotoemission}
\item Photoionization with a focus on alignment/RWP effects, including numerical studies \cite{Ramakrishna2012, Ramakrishna2013,hockett2015GeneralPhenomenologyIonization}, and MFPAD case-study \cite{reid2018AccessingMolecularFramea}.
\item LF and MFPADs theory review and tutorials (with numerical examples) \cite{hockett2018QMP1}
