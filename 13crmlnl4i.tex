\subsection{Theory literature sample\label{sec:theory-lit}}

A number of authors have developed relevant theory for photoionization problems. Whilst the fundamentals are similar, different formalisms have been derived for various specific cases, or to emphasize particular aspects of the problem. A few notable examples are listed here.

\begin{itemize}
\item Early derivations for atomic PADs \cite{Cherepkov1979,Cooper1968,Cooper1969,Klar1982}
\item Early derivations for molecular PADs \cite{Buckingham1970,Tully1968}, including angular momentum transfer \cite{Fano1972} and MFPADs ("fixed-in-space")
\end{itemize}
