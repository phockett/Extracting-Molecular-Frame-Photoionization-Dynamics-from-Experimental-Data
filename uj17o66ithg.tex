\subsection{Bootstrapping to the MF example case}

As detailed elsewhere [TBD/refs], the ``bootstapping" methodology proceeds via a multi-stage fitting protocol to obtain both the AF axis distribution (level 1 of the bootstrap, linear fit), and the photoionization matrix elements (level 2 of the bootstrap, non-linear fit). Further bootstrapping - in the statistical sense - can also be employed to probe the fitting with different samples from the source data (typically time-steps and/or) and this can be further iterated
