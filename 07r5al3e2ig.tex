\subsection{Outline and aims}

As stated previously, this topical review aims to discuss and survey current methodologies for measuring, or otherwise obtaining, MF photoionization properties. The aim here is not for a comprehensive literature review (for these, see, for example, refs. [....]), nor a thorough introduction to the core physics (for this, see, for example, refs. [...]), nor a re-tread of previously published materials. Instead, this review aims to present a (reader-extensible) tutorial overview of concepts, grounded in ab initio calculations (and open-science principles, with corresponding open-source code available online), and a survey of recent method development and experimental progress on the topic. In order to maintain relevance, and
