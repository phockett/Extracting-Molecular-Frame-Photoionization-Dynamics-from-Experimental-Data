\subsection{Outline and aims}

As stated previously, this topical review aims to discuss and survey current methodologies for measuring, or otherwise obtaining, MF photoionization properties. The aim here is not for a comprehensive literature review (for these, see, for example, refs. [....]), nor a thorough introduction to the core physics (for this, see, for example, refs. [...]), nor a re-tread of previously published materials. Instead, this review aims to present a (reader-extensible) tutorial overview of concepts, grounded in ab initio calculations (and open-science principles, with corresponding open-source code available online), and a survey of recent method development and experimental progress on the topic. In order to maintain relevance, and address any significant lacunae in the knowledge of the current authors,  a discussion group/wiki/Github repo [TBD] has also been created [ref/details....]. It is hoped that, in this way, this manuscript will become a living document, and a useful resource for interested researchers that will grow over time. It is also hoped that this manuscript, and especially the online discussions, will serve  to garner opinions from a cross-section of interested researchers, and help to bridge the gaps between the various, historically somewhat disparate, communities (espectroscopy, AMO physics, quantum information) intereseted in this topic.
