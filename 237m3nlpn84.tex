\subsubsection{Further bootstrapping: information content \& sensitivity}

As well as considering the results from full fits of the data, the inherent sensitivity of various aspects of the problem can also be investigated. In general, this will depend on the details of the problem at hand (symmetry, ADMs etc.), but can in essence be considered independently of the matrix elements themselves via ``channel functions" or equivalent [WILL BE DISCUSSED ABOVE? ALSO DENSITY MAT?]. In the PEMtk routines, the various component tensors are computed and packaged as a basis set prior to fitting, and can be further examined independently.
