\section{Resources\label{sec:resources}}

The following online resources are available, and it is hoped that interested readers will find these useful, and contribute.

\begin{itemize}
\item Manuscipt text, live (\href{https://www.authorea.com/users/71114/articles/447808-extracting-molecular-frame-photoionization-dynamics-from-experimental-data}{on Authorea}) and \href{https://github.com/phockett/Extracting-Molecular-Frame-Photoionization-Dynamics-from-Experimental-Data}{Github}. Post-publication reader comments \& suggestions can be added directly via the web.
\item Full bibligraphy, as a Zotero group (TODO). Additional references and suggestions can be added to the group, and it is hoped that this will grow to provide a useful community resource.
\item Code for AF computation and matrix element retrieval, as illustrated in Sect. XX. Full Jupyter notebooks are online (), along with the open-source python libraries \href{https://epsproc.readthedocs.io}{ePSproc} and \href{https://pemtk.readthedocs.io}{PEMtk} developed for these problems. [links to Github repos, also \cite{ePSprocAuthorea,ePSprocFigshare,ePSprocGithub}, also OSF/Figshare for paper-specific notebooks and such]
\item Discussion forum at \href{https://amoopenscience.femtolab.ca/}{AMO Open Science}. We hope interested readers will use this forum for general discussion on the topic, if only to suggest other venues for discussion.
\end{itemize}
