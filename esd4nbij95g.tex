\section{Resources}\label{sec:resources}

The following online resources are available, and it is hoped that interested readers will find these useful, and contribute.

\begin{itemize}
\item Manuscipt text, live on Authorea (\href{http://}{}) and Github (). Post-publication reader comments \& suggestions can be added directly via the web.
\item Full bibligraphy, as a Zotero group (). Additional references and suggestions can be added to the group, and it is hoped that this will grow to provide a useful community resource.
\item Code for AF computation and matrix element retrieval, as illustrated in Sect. XX. Full Jupyter notebooks are online (), along with the open-source python libraries ePSproc () and peQMtk ()/pmTK/pemTK/qmPEtk developed for these problems. [links to Github repos]
\item Discussion forum at AMO Open Sciece (). We hope interested readers will use this forum for general discussion on the topic, if only to suggest other venues for discussion.
\end{itemize}
