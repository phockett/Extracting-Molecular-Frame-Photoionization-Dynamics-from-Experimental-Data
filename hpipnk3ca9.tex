\subsubsection{Bootstrapping basics: fit results}

To fit the simulated data, a set of fitting parameters were defined in (magnitude, phase) form. In this case, the parameter set was simply defined from the input matrix elements, including symmetry relations, resulting in 6 complex radial matrix elements defining the problem (this equates to $2n-1$ parameters to determine in magnitude-phase form, where the -1 arises since the phases are relative, and one phase must be defined as a reference, either pre or post fit); in general this step in the protocol may require manual configuration for the problem at hand, based on the symmetry of the system. 

The PEMtk fitting matrix element fitting routine makes use of the lmfit package [REF, https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/, https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11813], which implements a range of fitting routines and options. In the current case a standard Levenberg-Marquardt minimization was used, and all (12) parameters were allowed to float freely. To gain insight into the efficiency of the fitting routine, and the uniqueness of the fit results [REF], 1000 fits were performed on the same dataset, each seeded with randomised parameter values. This methodology amounts to a statistical sampling of the solution hyperspace, which may be expected to contain some local minima in general high-dimensional cases [REF]. Convergence criteria were set as .... Running in parallel on 20 (logical) cores of an AMD Threadripper 2950X based workstation, this required ~5GB of RAM and took on the order of 2 hours (note that the time per fit cycle had large variance, since convergence time depends on the start parameters); further benchmarks for the current codebase can be found at [REF].

Results are summarised broadly in Fig. \ref{509194}, which shows the best fit results over the fits. A few conclusions from this case study:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The results appear to indicate a single global minima, with $\chi^2 < 2.3\times10^{-3}$. In the test case, 349 fits obtained this region of the fitting space, although there is some spread.
\item There are multiple bands of fits which converged to higher $\chi^2$; these are indicative of multiple local minima.
