In the direct case, access to the MF is sought via essentially one of two schemes:</div><ol><li>Orientation of the molecular frame.</li><li>Post-hoc reconstruction of the molecular frame from a suitable measurement.</li></ol><div>The first category covers a range of techniques. For gas phase experiments, the most common methods involve creating some form of alignment or orientation (<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="188911">in the technical sense, alignment retains mirror symmetry along an aligned axis, while orientation implies full 3D control over a set of axes - orientation is used herein as synonmous with the MF for an arbitrary molecular system, but in some cases - e.g. homonuclear diatomics - alignment may be sufficient for MF observables</span>) in the gas phase molecular ensemble, which defines a relationship between the LF and MF. In general, this can be termed as the aligned frame (AF), and may still involve averaging over some DOFs; in the limit of perfect orientation, the AF and MF are conformal/indistinguishable. Perhaps the simplest AF technique is the creation of alignment via a single-photon pump process (as used in many resonance-enhanced mulit-photon ionization (REMPI) type experimental schemes); in this case a parallel or perpendicular transition moment will create a $cos^2$ or $sin^2$ distribution, respectively, along the corresponding symmetry axis. </div><div>Further control can be gained via a single, or sequence of, N-photon transitions, or strong-field mediated techniques. Of the latter, adiabatic and non-adiabatic alignment methods are particularly powerful, and make use of a strong, slowly-varying or impulsive laser field respectively (where the time-scales are defined in relation to molecular rotations). In the former case, molecular axis, or axes, will gradually align along the electric-field vector(s) while the field is present; in the latter a broad rotational wavepacket can be created, initiating complex rotational dynamics including field-free revivals of ensemble alignment. Both techniques are powerful, but multiple laser fields are typically required in order to control more than one molecular axis, leading to relatively complex experimental requirements. The absolute degree of alignment obtained in a given case is also dependent on a number of intrinsic and experimental properties, including the molecular polarisability tensor, rotational temperature and separability of the rotational degrees of freedom(loosely speaking, this can be considered as the stiffness of the molecule). Therefore, although general in principle, in practice not all molecular targets are amenable to <i>good</i> alignment. Whilst gas phase alignment experiments can become rather complex, multi-pulse affairs, they are increasingly popular in the AMO community for a number of possible reasons - conceptually and experimentally, they are a relatively tractable extension to existing techniques, they are interesting experiments in their own right, and, practically, they are usually feasible with existing high-power laser sources.</div><div>An alternative, very different, technique of orientational control is via embedding the target species in a matrix, or deposition on a surface, which defines a spatial orientation. This approach has been taken by the surface science community, in particular in ARPES and SERS studies. In these techniques, molecular orientation is well-defined, but at the expense of interactions with the bulk. Such techniques are readily applied to a range of targets using existing experimental apparatus combined with suitably-prepared surfaces. Of particular note in this regard is SERS work making use of functionalised nano-particles for "single molecule" fluorescence studies. [more to say on ARPES?]</div><div>The second category covers methodologies which make use of experimental information to reconstruct, post-facto, molecular alignment at the time of interaction. This usually involves making a "kinematically complete" class of measurement, which provides the full energy or momentum partitioning of the products of a light-matter interaction. In order for the alignment of a given axis to be defined in this case, there must be clear energy partitioning along it - typically dissociation is required. For example, in the dissociation of a diatomic molecule, measuring the momentum of the two product atoms will&nbsp; Assuming that the system&nbsp;</div><div>[COLTRIMS, x-ray diffraction]</div><h2 data-label="506808" class="ltx_title_subsection">Analysis methodologies</h2><h1 data-label="533755" class="ltx_title_section">Literature review</h1><div>[May be integrated above?]</div><h1>Recent developments</h1><h1 data-label="356458" class="ltx_title_section">Outlook</h1><h1 data-label="748985" class="ltx_title_section">Resources</h1>
