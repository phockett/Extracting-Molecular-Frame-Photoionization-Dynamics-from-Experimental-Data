In the direct case, access to the MF is sought via essentially one of two schemes:</div><ol><li>Orientation of the molecular frame.</li><li>Post-hoc reconstruction of the molecular frame from a suitable measurement.</li></ol><div>The first category covers a range of techniques. For gas phase experiments, the most common methods involve creating some form of alignment or orientation (<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="188911">in the technical sense, alignment retains mirror symmetry along an aligned axis, while orientation implies full 3D control over a set of axes - orientation is used herein as synonmous with the MF for an arbitrary molecular system, but in some cases - e.g. homonuclear diatomics - alignment may be sufficient for MF observables</span>) in the gas phase molecular ensemble, which defines a relationship between the LF and MF. In general, this can be termed as the aligned frame (AF), and may still involve averaging over some DOFs; in the limit of perfect orientation, the AF and MF are conformal/indistinguishable. Perhaps the simplest AF technique is the creation of alignment via a single-photon pump process (as used in many resonance-enhanced mulit-photon ionization (REMPI) type experimental schemes); in thi case a parallel or per</div><h2 data-label="506808" class="ltx_title_subsection">Analysis methodologies</h2><h1 data-label="533755" class="ltx_title_section">Literature review</h1><div>[May be integrated above?]</div><h1>Recent developments</h1><h1 data-label="356458" class="ltx_title_section">Outlook</h1><h1 data-label="748985" class="ltx_title_section">Resources</h1>
