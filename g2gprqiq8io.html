<div>A very general problem in molecular physics is the determination of molecular properties from experimental measurements, and comparing such measurements with theoretical predictions. The key difficulty is, usually, the averaging or integration over unobserved degrees of freedom (quantum numbers) in the measurements. In many cases, careful experimental design&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="870268" class="ltx_title_section">Basic concepts</h1><h1 data-label="533755" class="ltx_title_section">Literature review</h1><h1>Recent developments</h1><h1 data-label="356458" class="ltx_title_section">Outlook</h1>
