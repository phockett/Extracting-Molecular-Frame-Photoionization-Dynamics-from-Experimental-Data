<div>A very general problem in molecular physics is the determination of intrinsic molecular properties from experimental measurements, and comparing such measurements with theoretical predictions. The key difficulty is, usually, the averaging or integration over unobserved degrees of freedom (DOF) in the measurements. In favourable cases, careful experimental design can obviate this issue via, for instance, state-selection prior to measurement; however, in most cases this is not feasible due to the inherent complexity of the system. The problem becomes significantly worse for larger systems as the number of DOFs (hence density of states) increases, and if the DOFs are continuous, rather than quantised, properties.&nbsp;</div><div>The difficulty of making a suitable measurements&nbsp;</div><div>A very general issue, which lacks a general solution, is the measurement of observables which depend on the orientation of the molecular frame (MF). In general, this can be regarded as a geometric problem, in which the intrinsic MF properties are averaged (or smeared out) in a given measurement.&nbsp;For instance, in a typical gas phase molecular spectroscopy measurement, the observables in the molecular frame  are averaged over all molecular orientations in a laboratory frame (LF) measurement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The inverse problem is also difficult, i.e. simulating specific experimental observables starting from ab initio calculations in the molecular frame. In this case, to simulate LF results, knowledge of the degree and type of geometric averaging is required.</div><div>Despite, or perhaps because of, the inherent difficulties, making MF measurements is currently a topic of great interest, and much pro</div><h1 data-label="870268" class="ltx_title_section">Basic concepts</h1><h1 data-label="533755" class="ltx_title_section">Literature review</h1><h1>Recent developments</h1><h1 data-label="356458" class="ltx_title_section">Outlook</h1>
