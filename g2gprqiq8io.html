<div>A very general problem in molecular physics is the determination of intrinsic molecular properties from experimental measurements, and comparing such measurements with theoretical predictions. The key difficulty is, usually, the averaging or integration over unobserved degrees of freedom (DOF) in the measurements. In favourable cases, careful experimental design can obviate this issue via, for instance, state-selection prior to measurement; however, in most cases this is not feasible due to the inherent complexity of the system. The problem becomes significantly worse for larger systems as the number of DOFs (hence density of states) increases, and if the DOFs are continuous, rather than quantised, properties.&nbsp;</div><div>A very general issue, of fundamental interest, which falls in this latter category&nbsp; - and lacks a general solution - is the measurement of observables which depend on the orientation of the molecular frame (MF). In general, this can be regarded as a geometric problem, in which the intrinsic MF properties are averaged (or smeared out) in a given measurement.&nbsp;For instance, in a typical gas phase molecular spectroscopy measurement, the observables in the molecular frame  are averaged over all possible molecular orientations in a laboratory frame (LF) measurement.&nbsp;The inverse problem is also difficult, i.e. simulating specific experimental observables starting from ab initio calculations in the molecular frame. In this case, to simulate LF results, knowledge of the degree and type of geometric averaging is required.</div><div>Despite, or perhaps because of, the inherent difficulties, obtaining  MF measurements remains a topic of great interest, and much progress in experimental methodologies has been made in recent decades. These techniques can be regarded as relatively&nbsp;<i>direct</i>, meaning that the methodologies seek to control or reconstruct the MF, hence measure MF observables, (somewhat) directly, with minimal data processing re.</div><div>Another avenue to MF properties is via what may be called&nbsp;<i>indirect</i> methodologies. In the current context, this is defined as methods which make use of detailed analysis procedures to reconstruct MF properties from LF measurements. Broadly speaking, one can consider indirect methods as a post-processing or analysis-based approach, with a significant computational requirement (akin to computational imaging techniques, as well as many traditional energy-domain spectroscopy techniques), while direct methods are, conceptually, closer to purely experimental methods, with more emphasis placed on detection techniques and capabilities. There is, naturally, significant overlap between these extremes, and most demonstrations fall somewhere on the spectrum between direct ("purely" experimental) and indirect. In particular, indirect approaches will typically require some degree of experimental control, and a set of associated measurements, to be useful - for example, LF measurements with different polarization geometries; direct measurements usually require specific molecular behaviour(s) in order to measure suitable observables.</div><h1 data-label="870268" class="ltx_title_section">Basic concepts</h1><h1 data-label="533755" class="ltx_title_section">Literature review</h1><h1>Recent developments</h1><h1 data-label="356458" class="ltx_title_section">Outlook</h1>
