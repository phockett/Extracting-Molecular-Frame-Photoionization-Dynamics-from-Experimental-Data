<div>A very general problem in molecular physics is the determination of intrinsic molecular properties from experimental measurements, and comparing such measurements with theoretical predictions. The key difficulty is, usually, the averaging or integration over unobserved degrees of freedom (DOF) in the measurements. In favourable cases, careful experimental design can obviate this issue via, for instance, state-selection prior to measurement; however, in most cases this is not feasible due to the inherent complexity of the system. The problem becomes significantly worse for larger systems as the number of DOFs (hence density of states) increases, and/or if the DOFs are continuous, rather than quantised, properties, and/or if many states are populated.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="265788" class="ltx_title_subsection">Molecular frame observables</h2><div>A very general issue, of fundamental interest, which falls in the latter categories&nbsp; - and lacks a general solution - is the measurement of observables which depend on the orientation of the molecular frame (MF). In general, this can be regarded as a geometric problem, in which the intrinsic MF properties are averaged (or smeared out) in a given measurement.&nbsp;For instance, in a typical gas phase molecular spectroscopy measurement, the observables in the molecular frame  are averaged over all possible molecular orientations in a laboratory frame (LF) measurement.&nbsp;The inverse problem is also difficult, i.e. simulating specific experimental observables starting from ab initio calculations in the molecular frame. In this case, to simulate LF results, knowledge of the degree and type of geometric averaging is required.</div><div>Despite, or perhaps because of, the inherent difficulties, obtaining  MF measurements remains a topic of great interest, and much progress in experimental methodologies has been made in recent decades. These techniques can be regarded as relatively&nbsp;<i>direct</i>, meaning that the methodologies seek to control or reconstruct the MF, hence measure MF observables, (somewhat) directly, with minimal data processing requirements.</div><div>Another avenue to MF observables is via what may be called&nbsp;<i>indirect</i> methodologies. In the current context, this can be defined as <i>techniques which make use of detailed theory and analysis procedures to reconstruct MF properties from LF measurements</i>. Broadly speaking, one can consider indirect methods as a post-processing or analysis-based approach, with a significant theoretical and computational requirement (akin to computational imaging techniques, as well as many traditional energy-domain spectroscopy techniques), while direct methods are, conceptually, closer to purely experimental methods, with more emphasis placed on detection techniques and capabilities, although significant numerical data analysis may still be required. There is, naturally, significant overlap between these extreme case definitions, and most methodologies and extant demonstrations fall somewhere on the spectrum between direct ("purely" experimental) and indirect. In particular, indirect approaches will typically still require some degree of experimental control, and a set of associated measurements, to be useful - for example, LF measurements with different polarization geometries; direct measurements usually require specific molecular behaviour(s) in order to measure suitable observables.</div><h2 data-label="394785" class="ltx_title_subsection">Observables, properties and dimensionality</h2><div>Fundamentally, experimental observables depend on intrinsic molecular properties, which may also be affected by experimental conditions/methods. In the  context of molecular physics, such properties are naturally expressed in the molecular frame - for instance: bond lengths, bond angles, polarisabilities, absorption cross-sections, dipole matrix elements and so on. As well as MF observables, one may be interested in determining the underlying intrinsic molecular properties which govern the observable, and/or&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="188894">exploring extrinsic properties</span> which modify or control the observable (e.g. application of laser field(s), preparation of specific molecular states). In some case the mapping between observable(s) and property/ies may be relatively direct, in other cases much less so!</div><div>A basic example - at least for simple molecules - is the determination of bond lengths from LF observables such as rotational energy spectra. In this case, the intrinsic molecular properties (bond lengths and geometry) map relatively cleanly to the observable energy levels, thus one can uniquely determine the properties of interest via a suitable data analysis methodology. In the simplest case, a homonuclear diatomic system, the problem can be regarded as 1-dimensional, with a single bond length to be determined from a 1D experimental measurement (the rotational energy spectrum) made in the LF. In this case, there is no issue with orientational averaging, since the position of features in the energy spectrum - determined by the (rotational) transition moments (which are tied to the molecular symmetry axes) -&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="188895">are invariant to orientation, although their magnitudes are not</span>. In this case, the intrinsic molecular properties can be mapped to the LF observable relatively clearly. </div><div>For more complicated systems, additional information may be required, e.g.</div><div>More generally, one can regard a hierarchy of difficulty in the determination of molecular properties, based on the complexity or dimensionality of the system and observable(s).</div><ol><li>Simple systems, “1D” methods, where a dataset of a single variable (e.g. rotational energy spectrum) is measured.&nbsp;&nbsp;    For simple cases, e.g. rigid diatomic molecules, the determination of molecular properties - the rotational energy levels and, hence, the bond length - is relatively direct. [Illustration?]   &nbsp;</li><li>Intermediate cases, e.g. larger, but fairly rigid, molecules (for instance, benzene), with congested spectra, the “direct” determination of molecular properties may not be possible without more sophisticated modelling and ab initio computations, and/or additional information from higher-dimensionality observables (e.g. polarization-dependent energy spectra).</li><li>    For the most complex cases, e.g. large, floppy molecules or complexes [examples...? recent floppy mol spectroscopy stuff?], determination of molecular properties in an absolute sense may be impossible (or, rather, may be a poorly posed question); high level computational results (if possible/tractable) may be required to understand the spectrum, and associated dynamics, along with multi-dimensional observables (e.g. temperature dependent spectra, dependence on isotopically-substituted species and so on).</li></ol><div>A generally more complicated example is the topic of this review, i.e. the determination of MF photoelectron distributions and the intrinsic molecular photoionization dynamics, the latter usually defined as the retrieval of the ionization dipole matrix elements. The difficulty in this case arises from the fact that there are typically many components (matrix elements) for even a simple system, and that determination of both magnitudes and phases is required. (This can be viewed as a form of quantum tomography, or a subset of quantum phase-retrieval problems.) In terms of the MF observable, these difficulties result in a quantity that is (in general) particularly susceptible to orientational averaging, and particularly sensitive to&nbsp;</div>
