<div>A very general problem in molecular physics is the determination of molecular properties from experimental measurements, and comparing such measurements with theoretical predictions. The key difficulty is, usually, the averaging or integration over unobserved degrees of freedom (quantum numbers) in the measurements. In favourable cases, careful experimental design can obviate the difficulties via, for instance, state-selection prior to measurement; however, in many cases this may not be possible due to the inherent complexity of the system, and the problem becomes significantly worse for larger systems. A very general issue, which lacks a general solution, is the measurement of quantities which depend on the orientation of the molecular frame (MF)</div><div>The inverse problem is also difficult, i.e. simulating specific experiemnts</div><h1 data-label="870268" class="ltx_title_section">Basic concepts</h1><h1 data-label="533755" class="ltx_title_section">Literature review</h1><h1>Recent developments</h1><h1 data-label="356458" class="ltx_title_section">Outlook</h1>
