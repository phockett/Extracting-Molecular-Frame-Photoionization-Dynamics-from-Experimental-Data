  abstract = {The wave nature of particles is rarely observed, in part because of their very short de Broglie wavelengths in most situations. However, even with wavelengths close to the size of their surroundings, the particles couple to their environment (for example, by gravity, Coulomb interaction, or thermal radiation). These couplings shift the wave phases, often in an uncontrolled way, and the resulting decoherence, or loss of phase integrity, is thought to be a main cause of the transition from quantum to classical behavior. How much interaction is needed to induce this transition? Here we show that a photoelectron and two protons form a minimum particle/slit system and that a single additional electron constitutes a minimum environment. Interference fringes observed in the angular distribution of a single electron are lost through its Coulomb interaction with a second electron, though the correlated momenta of the entangled electron pair continue to exhibit quantum interference.},

The technique is based on mixing the unknown object state with a known reference state generated in the same system by two delayed laser pulses, and detecting the total time- and frequency-integrated fluorescence as a function of the delay. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by reconstructing various vibrational wave packets in sodium dimers. Both the cases of completely controlled and noisy relative phase between the laser pulses are considered. In the latter case, we use the technique of coherence observation by interference noise to recover the interference component of the fluorescence signal. Our results clearly demonstrate the robustness of quantum-state holog- raphy and the high quality of reconstruction even in the presence of the external noise. ?S1050-2947?99?06403-3?},

The polarisation for the (nl)N subshell, with l\${$>\$$}or=1 and 1\${$<\$$}or=N\${$<\$$}or=4l+2, arises from spin-orbit splitting at the initial and (or) final states. To observe this polarisation it is necessary to select the photoelectrons corresponding to the transition from a particular fine-structure level of the initial state to a particular fine-structure level of the final state. The effect exists at all photon energies. The degree of polarisation depends on the energy and polarisation of the photons the angle of electron ejection and the atomic characteristics. After integration over the electron ejection angles the degree of polarisation becomes equal to zero when unpolarised or linearly polarised light is absorbed and remains non-zero for absorption of circularly polarised light. The degree of polarisation of the photoelectrons ejected from the 2p6 and 3p6 subshells of Ar and the 4d10 and 5p6 subshells of Xe, calculated in the random-phase approximation with exchange, is presented.},

The complete experiments performed for Xe atom demonstrated a good agreement between theory and experiment. The complete experiments in photoionization of diatomic molecules can be performed by measuring photoelectron angular distributions for fixed-in-space molecules with circularly or elliptically polarized light. The use of additional experimental data like the angular asymmetry parameter ?? and the ratio of ?? to ?? symmetry resolved cross sections made it possible to extract as many as 16 dipole matrix elements and phase shift differences for the C K-shell of CO molecule.

Calculations predict that two-color nonlinear WPI data can be used to reconstruct a rovibronic target wave packet evolving under an incompletely characterized nuclear Hamiltonian. This can be accomplished by the isolation via phase cycling or wave-vector matching of an exhaustive collection of overlaps between the unknown target and the members of a family of reference wave packets whose form is known by construction. This review highlights recent experiments employing WPI to gain amplitude-level information about the photoexcited-state dynamics of small molecules in the gas phase and in rare-gas crystals. I briefly describe a new semiclassical theory for condensed-phase WPI and other coherence-spectroscopy measurements, such as time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, and mention our initial studies of nonlinear WPI from electronic energy-transfer complexes.},

Coincidence spectroscopy is a powerful approach for carrying out a number of measurements. At its most basic level, coincidence techniques can identify the source of a specific signal, as in the well-known photoelectron-photoion coincidence approach used for several years. By carrying out coincidence experiments in an increasingly differential manner, correlated energy and angular distributions of reaction products may be recorded. Completely energy- and angle-resolved measurements of photoelectrons and ionic or neutral products can reveal molecular-frame photoelectron and photofragment angular distributions and aid in the characterization of dissociative states of molecules and ions. Recent work in this area is reviewed, including examples from studies of dissociative photodetachment, dissociative photoionization, time-resolved studies of dissociative photoionization, and three-body dissociation processes.},

  abstract = {Quantum operations describe any state change allowed in quantum mechanics, including the evolution of an open sys-tem or the state change due to a measurement. In this letter we present a general method based on quantum tomography for measuring experimentally the matrix elements of an arbi-trary quantum operation. As input the method needs only a single entangled state. The feasibility of the technique for the electromagnetic field is shown, and the experimental setup is illustrated based on homodyne tomography of a twin-beam. The typical state change in quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution, where the final state is related to the initial one via the transformation {$\rho$} \textrightarrow{} E({$\rho$}) {$\equiv$} U {$\rho$}U , with U unitary operator on the Hilbert space H of the system. Unitary transformations describe only the evolu-tions of closed systems, and non-unitary transformations occur when the quantum system is coupled to an en-vironment or when a measurement is performed on the system. What is the most general possible state change in quantum mechanics? The answer is provided by the formalism of  quantum operations  by Kraus [1]. Here input and output states are connected via the map {$\rho$} \textrightarrow{} E({$\rho$}) Tr E({$\rho$}) . (1)},

Time-resolved imaging interrogates the unfolding electronic motion in such systems. We find that scattering patterns, obtained by X-ray time-resolved imaging from an electronic wavepacket, encode spatial and temporal correlations that deviate substantially from the common notion of the instantaneous electronic density as the key quantity being probed. Surprisingly, the patterns provide an unusually visual manifestation of the quantum nature of light. This quantum nature becomes central only for non-stationary electronic states and has profound consequences for time-resolved imaging.},

  abstract      = {Ultrafast time-resolved x-ray scattering is an emerging approach to image the dynamical evolution of the electronic charge distribution during complex chemical and biological processes in real-space and real-time. Recently, the differences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) theory of light-matter interaction for scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from the electronic wavepacket were formally demonstrated and visually illustrated by scattering patterns calculated for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen [G. Dixit, O. Vendrell, and R. Santra, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109, 11636 (2012)]. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of time-resolved x-ray scattering from a sample containing a mixture of non-stationary and stationary electrons within both the theories. In a many-electron system, the role of scattering interference between a non-stationary and several stationary electrons to the total scattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical theory provide different results for the contribution from the scattering interference, which depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the x-ray pulse duration. The present findings are demonstrated by means of a numerical example of x-ray time-resolved imaging for an electronic wavepacket in helium. It is shown that the time-dependent scattering interference vanishes within semiclassical theory and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the time-independent interference, whereas the time-dependent scattering interference contribution do not vanish in the QED theory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the non-stationary electron scattering.},

Such `reaction microscopes' cover the full correlated momentum space of all fragments of an atomic reaction yielding kinematically complete information for each reaction event.

The molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs) as well as the s1 and s2 Stokes parameters characterizing the polarization state of the light, can be derived from a single experiment performed with undefined elliptically polarized light. Using this method, we report and discuss MFPADs for site selective K-shell ionization of the NO and N2O linear molecules in the region of the N 1s and O 1s shape resonances. A large molecular frame circular dichroism is observed well predicted by the multi-channel Schwinger configuration interaction calculations reported for PI of NO. We also present recent experimental results for PI of non-linear molecules like CH3Cl measured above the Cl 2p and C 1s ionization thresholds: the recoil frame photoelectron angular distributions (RFPADs) obtained by the vector correlation method may be influenced both by the molecular frame photoemission pattern and the fragmentation process.},

The MF observables intrinsically couple the ionized molecular orbital and the scattering wave function of the photoelectron in the ionization continuum. The field of molecular photoionization has benefited from the development of experimental methods based on the determination of electron-ion momentum vector correlations using position and time sensitive detectors, as well as from advanced ab initio calculations accounting for electronic correlations which influence the different steps of a photoionization reaction. Key features of valence shell and inner shell photoionization processes, involving resonant and non-resonant mechanisms, are illustrated for small molecules of increasing complexity: we emphasize the general formalism which describes molecular frame photoemission for single ionization of linear molecules induced by linearly and elliptically polarized light after one photon absorption, and its extensions to recoil frame photoemission when non-linear molecules or multiphoton processes are considered. The rich information contained in molecular frame photoemission is at the core of a number of recent experiments at the forefront of molecular physics.},

The technique combines bichromatic white light polarization pulse shaping with the tomographic reconstruction of photoelectron wave packets. The physical scheme is based on the interference of a probe wave packet from N + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization via the target states and a reference wave packet from M + 1 multiphoton ionization of the ground state. To create the wave packets, we employ carrier-envelope phase stable bichromatic (M{$\omega$}:N{$\omega$}) pump-probe pulse sequences. The scheme is demonstrated on femtosecond Rydberg wave-packet dynamics in potassium atoms using corotating circularly polarized (2{$\omega$}:3{$\omega$}) pulse sequences. The interference of continuum states with different angular momenta yields a crescent-shaped photoelectron wave packet rotating in the laser polarization plane due to the interplay of the optical phase and the accumulated quantum phase. Carrier-envelope phase control of the rotation provides access to the photoelectron asymmetry, enabling background-free detection of the crescent's angular motion which maps the bound-electron dynamics.},

  abstract = {In classical estimation theory, the central limit theorem implies that the statistical error in a measurement outcome can be reduced by an amount proportional to n\^(-1/2) by repeating the measures n times and then averaging. Using quantum effects, such as entanglement, it is often possible to do better, decreasing the error by an amount proportional to 1/n. Quantum metrology is the study of those quantum techniques that allow one to gain advantages over purely classical approaches. In this review, we analyze some of the most promising recent developments in this research field. Specifically, we deal with the developments of the theory and point out some of the new experiments. Then we look at one of the main new trends of the field, the analysis of how the theory must take into account the presence of noise and experimental imperfections.},

As with prior studies of MF reconstruction, the experimental side of this protocol is based upon time-resolved LF measurements in which a rotational wavepacket is prepared and probed as a function of time via photoionization, followed by a numerical reconstruction routine. In contrast to other methodologies, the protocol presented here does not require determination of the photoionization matrix elements, and consequently takes the relatively simple numerical form of a matrix equation. Significantly, this simplicity allows the successful reconstruction of MFPADs for nonlinear polyatomic molecules with D nh point group symmetry. We numerically demonstrate this scheme for two realistic molecular photoionization cases: N2 and C2H4. This new technique is expected to be generally applicable to a broad range of MF reconstruction problems involving photoionization of polyatomic molecules.},

  abstract = {The work presented in this thesis was carried out with the ultimate aim of learning about the photoionization dynamics of polyatomic molecules. This is a complex problem; in order to obtain sufficient experimental data to shed light on the dynamics careful measurement of photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) is required. Ideally these measurements are rotationally-resolved, and the angular distributions measured correspond to the formation of the molecular ion in a single rotational state. The ionization event, in the dipole approximation, can be completely described by the dipole matrix elements. If sufficient experimental data to determine the radial components of the matrix elements and associated phases, the dynamical parameters, can be obtained the photoionization experiment may be said to be complete. Analysis of such experiments requires that the initial state of the molecular system is also known, to this end resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) schemes can be used in order to populate a single quantum state prior to ionization. The experiments presented here follow this methodology, with various REMPI schemes used to prepare (pump) and ionize (probe) the molecule under study, and the velocity-map imaging (VMI) technique used to (simultaneously) record the photoelectron spectra and angular distributions. Two molecules have been studied experimentally, acetylene (C2H2) and ammonia (NH3). In both cases dynamical parameters pertaining to the formation of specific states (vibronic or vibrational) of the molecular ion have been determined from experimental data. Additionally, in the ammonia work, rotationally-resolved photoelectron images were obtained.},

Here we present the direct experimental recording of very-high-resolution and -fidelity molecular movies over more than one-and-a-half periods of the laser-induced rotational dynamics of carbonylsulfide (OCS) molecules. Utilising the combination of single quantum-state selection and an optimised two-pulse sequence to create a tailored rotational wavepacket, an unprecedented degree of field-free alignment, {$\langle$}cos2\texttheta 2D{$\rangle$}\,=\,0.96 ({$\langle$}cos2\texttheta{$\rangle$}\,=\,0.94) is achieved, exceeding the theoretical limit for single-pulse alignment. The very rich experimentally observed quantum dynamics is fully recovered by the angular probability distribution obtained from solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with parameters refined against the experiment. The populations and phases of rotational states in the retrieved time-dependent three-dimensional wavepacket rationalises the observed very high degree of alignment.},

By measuring the molecular-frame photoelectron emission patterns for a two-photon sequential K-shell ionization in coincidence with the fragment ions, and by sorting the data as a function of the measured kinetic energy release, we can resolve the elongation of the molecular bond by approximately 1.2 a.u. within the duration of the x-ray pulse.

  doi = {10.1103/RevModPhys.91.035005},
  abstract = {The angular momentum of molecules, or, equivalently, their rotation in three-dimensional space, is ideally suited for quantum control. Molecular angular momentum is naturally quantized, time evolution is governed by a well-known Hamiltonian with only a few accurately known parameters, and transitions between rotational levels can be driven by external fields from various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Control over the rotational motion can be exerted in one-, two-, and many-body scenarios, thereby allowing one to probe Anderson localization, target stereoselectivity of bimolecular reactions, or encode quantum information to name just a few examples. The corresponding approaches to quantum control are pursued within separate, and typically disjoint, subfields of physics, including ultrafast science, cold collisions, ultracold gases, quantum information science, and condensed-matter physics. It is the purpose of this review to present the various control phenomena, which all rely on the same underlying physics, within a unified framework. To this end, recall the Hamiltonian for free rotations, assuming the rigid rotor approximation to be valid, and summarize the different ways for a rotor to interact with external electromagnetic fields. These interactions can be exploited for control-from achieving alignment, orientation, or laser cooling in a one-body framework, steering bimolecular collisions, or realizing a quantum computer or quantum simulator in the many-body setting.},

  abstract = {Attosecond science is based on electron dynamics driven by a strong optical electric field and has evolved beyond its original scope in gas-phase atomic and molecular physics to solid-state targets. In this review, we discuss a nanoscale attosecond physics laboratory that has enabled the first observations of strong-field-driven photoemission and recollision at a solid surface: laser-triggered metallic nanotips. In addition to the research questions of rather fundamental nature, femtosecond electron sources with outstanding beam qualities have resulted from this research, which has prompted follow-up application in the sensing of electric fields and lightwave electronics, ultrafast microscopy and diffraction, and fundamental matter-wave quantum optics. We review the theoretical and experimental concepts underlying near-field enhancement, photoemission regimes and electron acceleration mechanisms. Nanotips add new degrees of freedom to well known strong-field phenomena from atomic physics. For example, they enable the realization of a true sub-optical-cycle acceleration regime where recollision is suppressed. We also discuss the possibility of high-harmonic generation due to laser irradiation of metallic nanostructures.},

We found that the inversion symmetry can be broken by absorption of a linearly polarized photon, which itself has inversion symmetry. In particular, the emission of a photoelectron with subsequent dissociation of the remaining H+2 fragment shows no symmetry with respect to the ionic H+ and neutral H atomic fragments. This lack of symmetry results from the entanglement between symmetric and antisymmetric H+2 states that is caused by autoionization. The mechanisms behind this symmetry breaking are general for all molecules.},

The recent development of optical cycling schemes for specific molecular species now allow each molecule to scatter up to {$\sim$}106 photons. This has proven sufficient for multiple groups to laser cool and slow molecular beams and, notably, capture molecules in magneto-optical traps (MOTs) and cool them to ultracold temperatures. MOTs are the workhorse technique for atomic physics in the ultracold regime and today's molecular MOTs represent a powerful starting point for the study and manipulation of ultracold molecular gases. This Topical Review presents a summary of the progress made in this new and emerging field.},

  abstract = {A high-resolution recoil-ion momentum spectrometer based on a precooled localized supersonic jet target (COLTRIMS) has been combined with a novel low-energy electron analyzer with 4{$\pi$} solid angle for electrons with energies Ee {$\leq$} 30 eV including Ee = 0 eV. Thus, three recoil-ion momentum components, the recoil-ion charge state and three momentum components of one electron emitted in any collision-induced ionization reaction are measured simultaneously with a coincidence efficiency of 28\%. In order to accept large recoil-ion longitudinal momenta (along the beam) of pR{$\Vert$} {$\leq$} 160 a.u. and simultaneously guarantee a superior resolution in this direction ({$\Delta$} PR{$\Vert$} {$\leq$} {$\pm$} 0.08 a.u.), recoil ions are extracted in the longitudinal direction different from all former concepts. Test measurements, details on the present design and results of a kinematically complete experiment for single ionization are presented and possible further improvements are discussed. The future potential of such spectrometers for the investigation of collision-induced atomic many-particle reactions, the ``Coulomb-explosion'' of molecules and the spectroscopy of electronic states in heavy few-electron systems is illustrated. Similar techniques might be used to measure angular correlations and even the neutrino mass in {$\beta$}-decay experiments.},

Experimental results are compared with the multiple-scattering calculations of Dill et al (1976 J. Chem. Phys. 65 3158) and with our new calculations in the relaxed-core Hartree-Fock approximation. Our calculations are in a better agreement with the experimental data though numerical discrepancies remain.

WPI is a fundamental and versatile scenario used to control a variety of quantum systems with a sequence of short laser pulses whose relative phase is finely adjusted to control the interference of electronic or nuclear wave packets (WPs). It is also useful in retrieving quantum information such as the amplitudes and phases of eigenfunctions superposed to generate a WP. Experimental and theoretical efforts to retrieve both the amplitude and phase information are recounted. This review also discusses information processing based on the eigenfunctions of atoms and molecules as one of the modern and future applications of coherent control. The ultrafast coherent control of ultracold atoms and molecules and the coherent control of complex systems are briefly discussed as future perspectives.},

Here we report on the identification of two prominent examples, interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) and radiative charge transfer (RCT), which are induced in argon dimers by electron collisions. After initial ionization of one dimer constituent ICD and RCT lead to the ionization of its neighbour either by energy transfer to or by electron transfer from the neighbour, respectively. By full quintuple-coincidence measurements, we unambiguously identify ICD and RCT, and trace the relaxation dynamics as function of the collisional excited state energies. Such interatomic processes multiply the number of electrons and shift their energies down to the critical 1\textendash 10\,eV range, which can efficiently cause chemical degradation of biomolecules. Therefore, the observed relaxation channels might contribute to cause efficient radiation damage in biological systems.},

It is accepted that DNA lesions (single- and double-strand breaks, for example) are induced by secondary species such as radicals, ions and the abundant low-energy secondary electrons generated by the primary radiation. Particularly harmful are dense ionization clusters of several ionization processes within a volume typical for the biomolecular system. Here we report the observation of a damage mechanism in the form of a non-local autoionizing process called intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD). It directly involves DNA constituents or other organic molecules in an aqueous environment. The products are two energetic ions and three reactive secondary electrons that can cause further damage in their vicinity. Hydrogen-bonded complexes that consist of one tetrahydrofuran (THF) molecule\textemdash a surrogate of deoxyribose in the DNA backbone\textemdash and one water molecule are used as a model system. After electron impact ionization of the water molecule in the inner-valence shell the vacancy is filled by an outer-valence electron. The released energy is transferred across the hydrogen bridge and leads to ionization of the neighbouring THF molecule. This energy transfer from water to THF is faster than the otherwise occurring intermolecular proton transfer. The signature of the ICD reaction is identified in triple-coincidence measurements of both ions and one of the final state electrons. These results could improve the understanding of radiation damage in biological tissue.},

Thus the motion of the ejected electron appears to be approaching the limit of motion in a spherically symmetric, screened Coulomb potential. At this limit, {$\beta$} has a form particularly easy to evaluate. We replace the screened Coulomb potential by the Coulomb potential itself, of strength Z, where Z is taken to be an adjustable parameter. We present arguments to justify this approximation based on the condition that at high energies the photoelectric conversion occurs most efficiently in the imme...},

We report a resolution of {$\sim$}2\textendash 4 \AA{} in the internuclear range {$\sim$}7\textendash 14 \AA{} using an 80-fs probe pulse. We discuss the ultimate spatial and temporal resolution of the technique, as well as the possibilities of observing dynamics of dissociating polyatomic molecules.

The transition dipoles and phase shifts thus determined are in reasonable agreement with those by state-to-state photoionization experiment and Schwinger variational calculations.

  abstract = {The authors report measured and computed molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs) and recoil frame photoelectron angular distributions (RFPADs) for the single photon ionization of the nonlinear molecule NO2 leading to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 and (4a1)-1 3A1 states of NO2+. Experimentally, the RFPADs were obtained using the vector correlation approach applied to the dissociative photoionization (DPI) involving these molecular ionic states. The polar and azimuthal angle dependences of the photoelectron angular distributions are measured relative to the reference frame provided by the ion recoil axis and direction of polarization of the linearly polarized light. Experimental results are reported for the photon excitation energies hnu=14.4 and 22.0 eV. Theoretically the authors give expressions for both the MFPAD and the RFPAD. They show that the functional form in the recoil frame, where an average over the azimuthal dependence of the molecular fragments about the recoil direction is made, is identical to that they have earlier found for the DPI experiments performed on linear molecules. MFPADs were then computed using single-center expansion techniques within the fixed-nuclei frozen-core Hartree-Fock approximation. The computed cross sections for ionization to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 state show a strong propensity for ionization with the polarization of the light perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, whereas the ionization to the (4a1)-1 3A1 state of the ion is of similar intensity for all orientations of the polarization of the light in the molecular frame. These qualitative features of the MFPAD are also evident in the RFPAD. The RFPAD for ionization leading to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 state is strongly peaked in the perpendicular orientation, whereas the RFPAD for ionization leading to the (4a2)-1 3A1 state is much more nearly isotropic. Comparison between experimental and theoretical RFPADs indicates that the recoil angle for NO+ fragments is approximately 50 degrees relative to the symmetry axis of the initial C2v symmetry of the NO2 molecule in the ionization leading to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 state and the recoil angle is approximately 120 degrees for the O+ fragment for ionization leading to the (4a1)-1 3A1 state.},

We examined the variation of the LF PAD against the intensity of the alignment laser, durations of the alignment and ionization laser pulses, and the time delay between these pulses.

This method is applied to the specific case of extracting molecular axis alignment from Coulomb explosion imaging probes in which the probe itself has a dependence on molecular orientation which often removes cylindrical symmetry from the experiment and prevents the use of standard inversion techniques for the recovery of the molecular axis distribution. By incorporating the known detection function, it is possible to remove the angular bias of the Coulomb explosion probe process and invert the image to allow quantitative measurement of the degree of molecular axis alignment.},

In addition to improved throughput resulting from parallelisation of data collection - imaging of multiple different fragments in velocity-map imaging studies, for example - fast image sensors also offer a number of fundamentally new capabilities in areas such as coincidence detection. In this Perspective, we review recent developments in fast image sensor technology, provide examples of their implementation in a range of different experimental contexts, and discuss potential future developments and applications.},

In the energy region near the ionization threshold, it has been demonstrated that the MFPAD can be understood by the interference between several partial waves. In the energy region higher than 100eV, the MFPAD has been interpreted by the intra-molecule photoelectron diffraction. That is, it has been verified that multiple-scattering X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) theory is a promising probe of the dynamical process. Therefore, we look into the future: a new methodology for molecular structure determination will be applied to determine ultrafast molecular structure changes due to ultrafast core-level XPD imaging from within, as demonstrated in our simulations for elemental processes of photo-induced unimolecular reactions.},

  abstract = {Quantum mechanically, photoionization can be fully described by the complex photoionization amplitudes that describe the transition between the ground state and the continuum state. Knowledge of the value of the phase of these amplitudes has been a central interest in photoionization studies and newly developing attosecond science, since the phase can reveal important information about phenomena such as electron correlation. We present a new attosecond-precision interferometric method of angle-resolved measurement for the phase of the photoionization amplitudes, using two phase-locked extreme ultraviolet pulses of frequency {$\omega$} and 2{$\omega$}, from a free-electron laser. Phase differences {$\Delta$}\texttildelow{$\eta$} between one- and two-photon ionization channels, averaged over multiple wave packets, are extracted for neon 2p electrons as a function of the emission angle at photoelectron energies 7.9, 10.2, and 16.6 eV. {$\Delta$}\texttildelow{$\eta$} is nearly constant for emission parallel to the electric vector but increases at 10.2 eV for emission perpendicular to the electric vector. We model our observations with both perturbation and ab initio theory and find excellent agreement. In the existing method for attosecond measurement, reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions (RABBITT), a phase difference between two-photon pathways involving absorption and emission of an infrared photon is extracted. Our method can be used for extraction of a phase difference between single-photon and two-photon pathways and provides a new tool for attosecond science, which is complementary to RABBITT.},

  abstract  = {The angular distributions of 1so-photoelectrons from N2 molecules held fixed in space have been measured around the or* shape resonance for the first time, The angular distributions have been very rich in structure, which are completely different from usual photoelectron angular distributions from randomly oriented molecules, as predicted by Dill. The orbital angular momentum properties of the 1scr photoelectrons around the o. * shape resonance have been made clear from the angular distribution patterns. PACS numbers: 33.80.Eh, 33.90.+h Molecular K-shell spectra are known to depart remark-ably from corresponding atomic spectra [1]. Specifically, above the K edge there is a broad band of enhanced pho-toabsorption in place of the smooth monotonic decrease one might expect. The novel feature, so called shape res-onance, results from the interaction between the photo-electron escaping from the K shell and the anisotropic molecular field [2]. Direct study of the orbital angular momentum properties of the photoelectrons in the shape resonance is not pos-sible by conventional gas-phase photoelectron angular distribution studies, owing to the random orientations of the molecules. If, however, the molecules have a definite orientation, the angular distributions of photoelectrons ejected by the electric-dipole interaction has the general form [3] 2\textasciitilde max g \textasciitilde KM' KM(0 tt') @=0 M where the angles (0, tb) are measured from the molecule g axis, I  is the maximum orbital angular momentum component of the outgoing photoelectron, and Y\textasciitilde M are the spherical harmonics. Thus, such photoelectron angular distributions of fixed-in-space molecules can offer a direct probe of the orbital angular momentum composition of the molecular photoelectrons. In the limited case, the angular distribution of photoelectrons from oriented H2 [4], CO [5], and N2 and CO [6] molecules were predicted by three groups. The present experiment has been undertaken to study the orbital angular momentum properties of the photo-electrons in a prototype molecular shape resonance \textemdash{} the o. * shape resonance of nitrogen molecules. In this Let-ter, we present the first experimental results on the an-gular distributions of lsd-photoelectrons ejected from Nz molecules held fixed in space. The photoionization pro-cesses of fixed-in-space molecules in a gas phase can be realized by detecting photoelectrons in coincidence with fragment ions as reported by Golovin et al. [7,8]. Since the dissociation time of the molecular ions produced by a subsequent Auger decay of the K-shell vacancy is much shorter than the molecular rotation period, the emission direction of the fragment ion is considered to be equiva-lent to the molecular orientation at a moment of absorp-tion of a photon. The experiments have been carried out on beam line BL-28, supplying the synchrotron radiation emitted from an undulator [9] inserted in the 2.5 GeV positron stor-age ring at the Photon Factory. The undulator radia-tion, monochromatized with a 10 m grazing incidence monochromator [10], was focused onto an effusive beam of the sample gas at the center of the ionization region of the experimental chamber. The entrance and exit slit openings of the monochromator were both set to 50 p, m. The expected energy resolution was about 0.6 eV at h p = 400 eV. The diameter of the photon beam spot at the sam-ple position was less than 0.2 mm. The first harmonic of the undulator radiation was used for all measurements de-scribed here. It had been confirmed in our previous work that the degree of linear polarization within the first har-monic peak of the undulator radiation is more than 95\% [11]. Two identical ion detectors (channeltrons) with re-tarding grids were installed in the chamber at 0 and 90 relative to the polarization vector of the incident radiation in the plane perpendicular to the radiation path. A re-tarding potential of +3 V was applied to the grid of each detector to select energetic fragment ions only. Each de-tector has a collection half-angle of 10.5 . A parallel plate electrostatic analyzer with a position sensitive detector (a microchannel plate and a resistive anode), which can be rotated around the photon beam axis, was used to energy analyze photoelectrons [11]. The effective acceptance an-gle of the analyzer was estimated to be \textasciitilde 5 . To obtain coincidence signals between photoelectrons and fragment ions, event signals from the electron detector were fed into two time-to-amplitude cogverters to start them at the same time, and signals from one ion detector were used to stop one of the converters and signals from the other detector to stop the other. As demonstrated in our previous work [11 \textemdash{} 19], the en-ergetic fragment-ion angular distributions after the K-shell excitations of diatomic molecules induced by linearly polarized radiation have enabled us to decompose the conventional photoabsorption spectra into their molecular 0031-9007/95/74(3)/359(4)\$06. 00 1995 The American Physical Society 359},
