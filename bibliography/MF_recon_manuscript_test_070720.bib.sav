The technique is based on mixing the unknown object state with a known reference state generated in the same system by two delayed laser pulses, and detecting the total time- and frequency-integrated fluorescence as a function of the delay. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by reconstructing various vibrational wave packets in sodium dimers. Both the cases of completely controlled and noisy relative phase between the laser pulses are considered. In the latter case, we use the technique of coherence observation by interference noise to recover the interference component of the fluorescence signal. Our results clearly demonstrate the robustness of quantum-state holog- raphy and the high quality of reconstruction even in the presence of the external noise. ?S1050-2947?99?06403-3?},

the (nl)N subshell, with l\${$>\$$}or=1 and 1\${$<\$$}or=N\${$<\$$}or=4l+2, arises
from spin-orbit splitting at the initial and (or) final states. To
observe this polarisation it is necessary to select the photoelectrons
corresponding to the transition from a particular fine-structure
level of the initial state to a particular fine-structure level of
the final state. The effect exists at all photon energies. The degree
of polarisation depends on the energy and polarisation of the photons,
the angle of electron ejection and the atomic characteristics. After
integration over the electron ejection angles the degree of polarisation
becomes equal to zero when unpolarised or linearly polarised light
is absorbed and remains non-zero for absorption of circularly polarised
light. The degree of polarisation of the photoelectrons ejected from
the 2p6 and 3p6 subshells of Ar and the 4d10 and 5p6 subshells of
Xe, calculated in the random-phase approximation with exchange, is
presented.},

Two relations connecting the spin polarization parameters and the parameters characterizing the ion polarization state are presented. The complete experiments performed for Xe atom demonstrated a good agreement between theory and experiment. The complete experiments in photoionization of diatomic molecules can be performed by measuring photoelectron angular distributions for fixed-in-space molecules with circularly or elliptically polarized light. The use of additional experimental data like the angular asymmetry parameter ?? and the ratio of ?? to ?? symmetry resolved cross sections made it possible to extract as many as 16 dipole matrix elements and phase shift differences for the C K-shell of CO molecule.

Calculations predict that two-color nonlinear WPI data can be used to reconstruct a rovibronic target wave packet evolving under an incompletely characterized nuclear Hamiltonian. This can be accomplished by the isolation via phase cycling or wave-vector matching of an exhaustive collection of overlaps between the unknown target and the members of a family of reference wave packets whose form is known by construction. This review highlights recent experiments employing WPI to gain amplitude-level information about the photoexcited-state dynamics of small molecules in the gas phase and in rare-gas crystals. I briefly describe a new semiclassical theory for condensed-phase WPI and other coherence-spectroscopy measurements, such as time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, and mention our initial studies of nonlinear WPI from electronic energy-transfer complexes.},

Coincidence spectroscopy is a powerful approach for carrying out a number of measurements. At its most basic level, coincidence techniques can identify the source of a specific signal, as in the well-known photoelectron-photoion coincidence approach used for several years. By carrying out coincidence experiments in an increasingly differential manner, correlated energy and angular distributions of reaction products may be recorded. Completely energy- and angle-resolved measurements of photoelectrons and ionic or neutral products can reveal molecular-frame photoelectron and photofragment angular distributions and aid in the characterization of dissociative states of molecules and ions. Recent work in this area is reviewed, including examples from studies of dissociative photodetachment, dissociative photoionization, time-resolved studies of dissociative photoionization, and three-body dissociation processes.},

  abstract      = {Quantum operations describe any state change allowed in quantum mechanics, including the evolution of an open sys-tem or the state change due to a measurement. In this letter we present a general method based on quantum tomography for measuring experimentally the matrix elements of an arbi-trary quantum operation. As input the method needs only a single entangled state. The feasibility of the technique for the electromagnetic field is shown, and the experimental setup is illustrated based on homodyne tomography of a twin-beam. The typical state change in quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution, where the final state is related to the initial one via the transformation {$\rho$} \textrightarrow{} E({$\rho$}) {$\equiv$} U {$\rho$}U , with U unitary operator on the Hilbert space H of the system. Unitary transformations describe only the evolu-tions of closed systems, and non-unitary transformations occur when the quantum system is coupled to an en-vironment or when a measurement is performed on the system. What is the most general possible state change in quantum mechanics? The answer is provided by the formalism of " quantum operations " by Kraus [1]. Here input and output states are connected via the map {$\rho$} \textrightarrow{} E({$\rho$}) Tr E({$\rho$}) . (1)},

Time-resolved imaging interrogates the unfolding electronic motion in such systems. We find that scattering patterns, obtained by X-ray time-resolved imaging from an electronic wavepacket, encode spatial and temporal correlations that deviate substantially from the common notion of the instantaneous electronic density as the key quantity being probed. Surprisingly, the patterns provide an unusually visual manifestation of the quantum nature of light. This quantum nature becomes central only for non-stationary electronic states and has profound consequences for time-resolved imaging.},

  abstract      = {Ultrafast time-resolved x-ray scattering is an emerging approach to image the dynamical evolution of the electronic charge distribution during complex chemical and biological processes in real-space and real-time. Recently, the differences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) theory of light-matter interaction for scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from the electronic wavepacket were formally demonstrated and visually illustrated by scattering patterns calculated for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen [G. Dixit, O. Vendrell, and R. Santra, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109, 11636 (2012)]. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of time-resolved x-ray scattering from a sample containing a mixture of non-stationary and stationary electrons within both the theories. In a many-electron system, the role of scattering interference between a non-stationary and several stationary electrons to the total scattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical theory provide different results for the contribution from the scattering interference, which depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the x-ray pulse duration. The present findings are demonstrated by means of a numerical example of x-ray time-resolved imaging for an electronic wavepacket in helium. It is shown that the time-dependent scattering interference vanishes within semiclassical theory and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the time-independent interference, whereas the time-dependent scattering interference contribution do not vanish in the QED theory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the non-stationary electron scattering.},

Such `reaction microscopes' cover the full correlated momentum space of all fragments of an atomic reaction yielding kinematically complete information for each reaction event. For the first time in atomic collision physics fully differential data became available in the sense that not only the momenta of all fragments, but also the complete momentum space is observed in one experiment. Recent results achieved with this new technique for slow p-He collisions and threshold photo ionization of He will be discussed.},

The molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs),
as well as the s1 and s2 Stokes parameters characterizing the polarization
state of the light, can be derived from a single experiment performed
with undefined elliptically polarized light. Using this method, we
report and discuss MFPADs for site selective K-shell ionization of
the NO and N2O linear molecules in the region of the N 1s and O 1s
shape resonances. A large molecular frame circular dichroism is observed,
well predicted by the multi-channel Schwinger configuration interaction
calculations reported for PI of NO. We also present recent experimental
results for PI of non-linear molecules like CH3Cl measured above
the Cl 2p and C 1s ionization thresholds: the recoil frame photoelectron
angular distributions (RFPADs) obtained by the vector correlation
method may be influenced both by the molecular frame photoemission
pattern and the fragmentation process.},

The technique combines bichromatic white light polarization pulse shaping with the tomographic reconstruction of photoelectron wave packets. The physical scheme is based on the interference of a probe wave packet from N + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization via the target states and a reference wave packet from M + 1 multiphoton ionization of the ground state. To create the wave packets, we employ carrier-envelope phase stable bichromatic (M{$\omega$}:N{$\omega$}) pump-probe pulse sequences. The scheme is demonstrated on femtosecond Rydberg wave-packet dynamics in potassium atoms using corotating circularly polarized (2{$\omega$}:3{$\omega$}) pulse sequences. The interference of continuum states with different angular momenta yields a crescent-shaped photoelectron wave packet rotating in the laser polarization plane due to the interplay of the optical phase and the accumulated quantum phase. Carrier-envelope phase control of the rotation provides access to the photoelectron asymmetry, enabling background-free detection of the crescent's angular motion which maps the bound-electron dynamics.},

Abstract: Quantum mechanics, through the Heisen-berg uncertainty principle, imposes limits to the pre-cision of measurement. Conventional measurement techniques typically fail to reach these limits. Con-ventional bounds to the precision of measurements such as the shot noise limit or the standard quan-tum limit are not as fundamental as the Heisenberg limits, and can be beaten using quantum strategies that employ 'quantum tricks' such as squeezing and entanglement.},

Using quantum effects, such as entanglement, it is often possible to do better, decreasing the error by an amount proportional to 1/n. Quantum metrology is the study of those quantum techniques that allow one to gain advantages over purely classical approaches. In this review, we analyze some of the most promising recent developments in this research field. Specifically, we deal with the developments of the theory and point out some of the new experiments. Then we look at one of the main new trends of the field, the analysis of how the theory must take into account the presence of noise and experimental imperfections.},

  abstract  = {The work presented in this thesis was carried out with the ultimate aim of learning about the photoionization dynamics of polyatomic molecules. This is a complex problem; in order to obtain sufficient experimental data to shed light on the dynamics careful measurement of photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) is required. Ideally these measurements are rotationally-resolved, and the angular distributions measured correspond to the formation of the molecular ion in a single rotational state. The ionization event, in the dipole approximation, can be completely described by the dipole matrix elements. If sufficient experimental data to determine the radial components of the matrix elements and associated phases, the dynamical parameters, can be obtained the photoionization experiment may be said to be complete. Analysis of such experiments requires that the initial state of the molecular system is also known, to this end resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) schemes can be used in order to populate a single quantum state prior to ionization. The experiments presented here follow this methodology, with various REMPI schemes used to prepare (pump) and ionize (probe) the molecule under study, and the velocity-map imaging (VMI) technique used to (simultaneously) record the photoelectron spectra and angular distributions. Two molecules have been studied experimentally, acetylene (C2H2) and ammonia (NH3). In both cases dynamical parameters pertaining to the formation of specific states (vibronic or vibrational) of the molecular ion have been determined from experimental data. Additionally, in the ammonia work, rotationally-resolved photoelectron images were obtained.},

We found that the inversion symmetry can be broken by absorption of a linearly polarized photon, which itself has inversion symmetry. In particular, the emission of a photoelectron with subsequent dissociation of the remaining H+2 fragment shows no symmetry with respect to the ionic H+ and neutral H atomic fragments. This lack of symmetry results from the entanglement between symmetric and antisymmetric H+2 states that is caused by autoionization. The mechanisms behind this symmetry breaking are general for all molecules.},

WPI is a fundamental and versatile scenario used to control a variety of quantum systems with a sequence of short laser pulses whose relative phase is finely adjusted to control the interference of electronic or nuclear wave packets (WPs). It is also useful in retrieving quantum information such as the amplitudes and phases of eigenfunctions superposed to generate a WP. Experimental and theoretical efforts to retrieve both the amplitude and phase information are recounted. This review also discusses information processing based on the eigenfunctions of atoms and molecules as one of the modern and future applications of coherent control. The ultrafast coherent control of ultracold atoms and molecules and the coherent control of complex systems are briefly discussed as future perspectives.},

Calculations are performed for the angular distributions of electrons ejected from molecules of the following symmetries: C3{$\nu$} (distorted CH4 as an example of a nonlinear, polar molecules), D3h (planar CH3 as an example of a nonlinear, nonpolar molecules), and Td (CH4 as another example of a nonlinear, nonpolar molecules). The initial molecules orbitals are represented as symmetry orbitals in the LCAO form, re-expanded about the carbon atom. These orbitals are in parametrized form such that the features of the angular distributions can be related to selected parameters. The ejected electron is assumed to move in a multicenter screened Coulomb field, and the set of coupled differential equations which describe its motion relative to the distance from the carbon atom is solved ...},

Previous studies are indicative that the motion of the ejected electron is dominated by the monopole term of the electron-molecular ion potential expanded about the molecular center of mass when the ratio of the orbital velocity of the bound electron to the velocity of the ejected electron is smaller than about 1:2. Thus the motion of the ejected electron appears to be approaching the limit of motion in a spherically symmetric, screened Coulomb potential. At this limit, {$\beta$} has a form particularly easy to evaluate. We replace the screened Coulomb potential by the Coulomb potential itself, of strength Z, where Z is taken to be an adjustable parameter. We present arguments to justify this approximation based on the condition that at high energies the photoelectric conversion occurs most efficiently in the imme...},

  abstract  = {The angular distributions of 1so-photoelectrons from N2 molecules held fixed in space have been measured around the or* shape resonance for the first time, The angular distributions have been very rich in structure, which are completely different from usual photoelectron angular distributions from randomly oriented molecules, as predicted by Dill. The orbital angular momentum properties of the 1scr photoelectrons around the o. * shape resonance have been made clear from the angular distribution patterns. PACS numbers: 33.80.Eh, 33.90.+h Molecular K-shell spectra are known to depart remark-ably from corresponding atomic spectra [1]. Specifically, above the K edge there is a broad band of enhanced pho-toabsorption in place of the smooth monotonic decrease one might expect. The novel feature, so called shape res-onance, results from the interaction between the photo-electron escaping from the K shell and the anisotropic molecular field [2]. Direct study of the orbital angular momentum properties of the photoelectrons in the shape resonance is not pos-sible by conventional gas-phase photoelectron angular distribution studies, owing to the random orientations of the molecules. If, however, the molecules have a definite orientation, the angular distributions of photoelectrons ejected by the electric-dipole interaction has the general form [3] 2\textasciitilde max g \textasciitilde KM' KM(0 tt') @=0 M where the angles (0, tb) are measured from the molecule g axis, I " is the maximum orbital angular momentum component of the outgoing photoelectron, and Y\textasciitilde M are the spherical harmonics. Thus, such photoelectron angular distributions of fixed-in-space molecules can offer a direct probe of the orbital angular momentum composition of the molecular photoelectrons. In the limited case, the angular distribution of photoelectrons from oriented H2 [4], CO [5], and N2 and CO [6] molecules were predicted by three groups. The present experiment has been undertaken to study the orbital angular momentum properties of the photo-electrons in a prototype molecular shape resonance \textemdash{} the o. * shape resonance of nitrogen molecules. In this Let-ter, we present the first experimental results on the an-gular distributions of lsd-photoelectrons ejected from Nz molecules held fixed in space. The photoionization pro-cesses of fixed-in-space molecules in a gas phase can be realized by detecting photoelectrons in coincidence with fragment ions as reported by Golovin et al. [7,8]. Since the dissociation time of the molecular ions produced by a subsequent Auger decay of the K-shell vacancy is much shorter than the molecular rotation period, the emission direction of the fragment ion is considered to be equiva-lent to the molecular orientation at a moment of absorp-tion of a photon. The experiments have been carried out on beam line BL-28, supplying the synchrotron radiation emitted from an undulator [9] inserted in the 2.5 GeV positron stor-age ring at the Photon Factory. The undulator radia-tion, monochromatized with a 10 m grazing incidence monochromator [10], was focused onto an effusive beam of the sample gas at the center of the ionization region of the experimental chamber. The entrance and exit slit openings of the monochromator were both set to 50 p, m. The expected energy resolution was about 0.6 eV at h p = 400 eV. The diameter of the photon beam spot at the sam-ple position was less than 0.2 mm. The first harmonic of the undulator radiation was used for all measurements de-scribed here. It had been confirmed in our previous work that the degree of linear polarization within the first har-monic peak of the undulator radiation is more than 95\% [11]. Two identical ion detectors (channeltrons) with re-tarding grids were installed in the chamber at 0 and 90 relative to the polarization vector of the incident radiation in the plane perpendicular to the radiation path. A re-tarding potential of +3 V was applied to the grid of each detector to select energetic fragment ions only. Each de-tector has a collection half-angle of 10.5 . A parallel plate electrostatic analyzer with a position sensitive detector (a microchannel plate and a resistive anode), which can be rotated around the photon beam axis, was used to energy analyze photoelectrons [11]. The effective acceptance an-gle of the analyzer was estimated to be \textasciitilde 5 . To obtain coincidence signals between photoelectrons and fragment ions, event signals from the electron detector were fed into two time-to-amplitude cogverters to start them at the same time, and signals from one ion detector were used to stop one of the converters and signals from the other detector to stop the other. As demonstrated in our previous work [11 \textemdash{} 19], the en-ergetic fragment-ion angular distributions after the K-shell excitations of diatomic molecules induced by linearly polarized radiation have enabled us to decompose the conventional photoabsorption spectra into their molecular 0031-9007/95/74(3)/359(4)\$06. 00 1995 The American Physical Society 359},

  abstract  = {The authors report measured and computed molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs) and recoil frame photoelectron angular distributions (RFPADs) for the single photon ionization of the nonlinear molecule NO2 leading to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 and (4a1)-1 3A1 states of NO2+. Experimentally, the RFPADs were obtained using the vector correlation approach applied to the dissociative photoionization (DPI) involving these molecular ionic states. The polar and azimuthal angle dependences of the photoelectron angular distributions are measured relative to the reference frame provided by the ion recoil axis and direction of polarization of the linearly polarized light. Experimental results are reported for the photon excitation energies hnu=14.4 and 22.0 eV. Theoretically the authors give expressions for both the MFPAD and the RFPAD. They show that the functional form in the recoil frame, where an average over the azimuthal dependence of the molecular fragments about the recoil direction is made, is identical to that they have earlier found for the DPI experiments performed on linear molecules. MFPADs were then computed using single-center expansion techniques within the fixed-nuclei frozen-core Hartree-Fock approximation. The computed cross sections for ionization to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 state show a strong propensity for ionization with the polarization of the light perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, whereas the ionization to the (4a1)-1 3A1 state of the ion is of similar intensity for all orientations of the polarization of the light in the molecular frame. These qualitative features of the MFPAD are also evident in the RFPAD. The RFPAD for ionization leading to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 state is strongly peaked in the perpendicular orientation, whereas the RFPAD for ionization leading to the (4a2)-1 3A1 state is much more nearly isotropic. Comparison between experimental and theoretical RFPADs indicates that the recoil angle for NO+ fragments is approximately 50 degrees relative to the symmetry axis of the initial C2v symmetry of the NO2 molecule in the ionization leading to the (1a2)-1 b 3A2 state and the recoil angle is approximately 120 degrees for the O+ fragment for ionization leading to the (4a1)-1 3A1 state.},

We consider two independent processes of the dynamical alignment of molecules in the electronic ground state by an intense femtosecond laser pulse ({$>$}10 TW/cm2) and one-photon ionization or (2+1) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization of the aligned molecules by a weak laser pulse ({$<$}10 GW/cm2). We examined the variation of the LF PAD against the intensity of the alignment laser, durations of the alignment and ionization laser pulses, and the time delay between these pulses. The LF PAD obtained from the ionization of the aligned ensemble shows a semiquantitative agreement with the PAD in the molecular frame.},

Example applications of such sensors range from fundamental scattering studies of chemical reaction mechanisms through to imaging mass spectrometry of surfaces, neutron scattering studies aimed at probing the structure of materials, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements to elucidate the structure and function of biomolecules. In addition to improved throughput resulting from parallelisation of data collection - imaging of multiple different fragments in velocity-map imaging studies, for example - fast image sensors also offer a number of fundamentally new capabilities in areas such as coincidence detection. In this Perspective, we review recent developments in fast image sensor technology, provide examples of their implementation in a range of different experimental contexts, and discuss potential future developments and applications.},

Two different schemes are investigated: threshold electrons produced by one-photon ionization with parallel laser polarization and above threshold ionization electrons produced by a two-photon transition with crossed laser polarization. Our results show that the temporal coherence of light pulses is transferred to free electron wave packets, thus opening the door to a whole variety of exciting experiments.},

In the energy region near the ionization threshold, it has been demonstrated that the MFPAD can be understood by the interference between several partial waves. In the energy region higher than 100eV, the MFPAD has been interpreted by the intra-molecule photoelectron diffraction. That is, it has been verified that multiple-scattering X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) theory is a promising probe of the dynamical process. Therefore, we look into the future: a new methodology for molecular structure determination will be applied to determine ultrafast molecular structure changes due to ultrafast core-level XPD imaging from within, as demonstrated in our simulations for elemental processes of photo-induced unimolecular reactions.},
