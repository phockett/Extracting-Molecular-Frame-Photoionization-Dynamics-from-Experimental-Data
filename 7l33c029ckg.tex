\subsection{Photoionization observables, properties and dimensionality\label{sec:Photo-into}}

Fundamentally, experimental observables depend on intrinsic molecular properties. In the  context of molecular physics, such properties are naturally expressed in the molecular frame - for instance: bond lengths, bond angles, polarisabilities, absorption cross-sections, dipole matrix elements and so on. Whilst it is often the case that such properties may be viewed as stationary, or approximately semi-classical - e.g. the equilibrium or average bond-lengths of a system is often viewed as a molecular property, rather than the associated vibrational wavefunction - ultimately the dynamics of the system are also of great interest. In this sense, the observables in a given case may also be affected by experimental conditions/methods, and degrees-of-freedom/dynamics, and one seeks a ``maximum information" measurement to try and understand or quantitatively determine the various effects at play.

As well as MF observables, one may be interested in determining the underlying intrinsic molecular properties which govern the observable, and/or exploring extrinsic properties which modify or control the observable (e.g. application of laser field(s), preparation of specific molecular states or wavepacket dynamics). In some case the mapping between observable(s) and property/ies may be relatively direct, in other cases much less so!

\subsubsection{A brief discussion of rotation: 1D problems and beyond}

A basic, traditional, example - at least for simple molecules - is the determination of bond lengths from LF measurements of rotational energy spectra. In this case, the intrinsic molecular properties (equilibrium bond lengths and geometry) map relatively cleanly to the observable energy levels, thus one can uniquely determine the properties of interest via a suitable data analysis methodology (for a general introduction, see ref. \cite{hollasHighRes}). For instance, in the simplest case, a homonuclear diatomic system, the problem can be regarded as 1-dimensional, with a single bond length to be determined from a 1D experimental measurement (the rotational energy spectrum) made in the LF. In this case, there is no issue with orientational averaging, since the position of features in the energy spectrum - determined by the (rotational) transition moments (which are tied to the molecular symmetry axes) - are invariant to orientation, although their magnitudes (or, more precisely, their projection into the LF) are not. In this case, the intrinsic molecular properties can therefore be mapped to the LF observable relatively clearly, and the retrieval of these properties from a measurement is similarly direct. However, for more complicated systems, additional information may be required, either in terms of a richer ND (N-dimensional) measurement technique and/or a series of simple measurements with different ``control" parameters.

% For more complicated systems, additional information may be required, e.g.

More generally, one can regard a hierarchy of difficulty in the determination of molecular properties, based on the complexity or dimensionality of the system and observable(s).
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple systems, ``1D” methods, where a dataset of a single variable (e.g. rotational energy spectrum) is measured. For simple cases, e.g. rigid diatomic molecules, the determination of molecular properties - the rotational energy levels and, hence, the bond length - is relatively direct. (See, for example, Chpt. 5 in ref. \cite{hollasHighRes}.) % [Illustration?]   
\item Intermediate cases, e.g. larger, but fairly rigid, molecules (for instance, formaldehyde $H_2CO$ and aniline, $C_6NH_7$, as discussed in ref. \cite{hollasHighRes}), possibly with congested spectra, the ``direct” determination of molecular properties may not be possible without more sophisticated modelling and ab initio computations, and/or additional information from higher-dimensionality observables (e.g. polarization-dependent energy spectra). An interesting example, and relevant to latter discussion herein, is the use of rotational coherence spectroscopy (RCS) in such cases \cite{Felker1987} - this can be considered as the narrow-wavepacket limit of more general (non-adiabatic) rotational wavepacket based methods (Sect. \ref{sec:MF-control}).
% \textbf{I think RCS is also used for such systems. Should probably cite something from Fleker.}
\item For the most complex cases, e.g. large, floppy molecules or complexes \cite{bunkerMolSymm,schmiedt2015SymmetryExtremelyFloppy}, determination of molecular properties in an absolute sense may be impossible (or, rather, may be a poorly posed question); high level computational results (if possible/tractable) may be required to understand the spectrum, and associated dynamics, along with multi-dimensional observables (e.g. temperature dependent spectra, dependence on isotopically-substituted species and so on).
\end{itemize}    

Whilst this discussion may seem a little arbitrary initially, there is a strong link between traditional rotational spectroscopy and modern molecular alignment techniques (as will be discussed later), and averaging over rotational (geometric) DOFs is key to stepping into the MF in time-domain experiments.

\subsubsection{Photoelectron flux in the LF and MF}

A (generally) more complicated example is the topic of this article, i.e. the determination of MF photoelectron distributions, and the intrinsic molecular photoionization dynamics which underlie the observables.  The former may involve direct or indirect techniques; the latter is usually defined as the retrieval of the (complex valued) ionization dipole matrix elements, hence is indirect by definition (since phase information may not be directly measured). The observables of interest - the photoelectron flux as a function of energy, ejection angle, and time - can be written generally as an expansion in spherical harmonics:

\begin{equation}
\bar{I}(\epsilon,t,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{L=0}^{2n}\sum_{M=-L}^{L}\bar{\beta}_{L,M}(\epsilon,t)Y_{L,M}(\theta,\phi)\label{eq:AF-PAD-general}
\end{equation}

Here the flux in the laboratory frame (LF) or aligned frame (AF) is denoted $\bar{I}(\epsilon,t,\theta,\phi)$, with the bar signifying ensemble averaging, and the molecular frame flux by $I(\epsilon,t,\theta,\phi)$.  Similarly, the expansion parameters $\bar{\beta}_{L,M}(\epsilon,t)$ include a bar for the LF/AF case. These observables are generally termed photoelectron angular distributions (PADs), often with a prefix denoting the reference frame, e.g. LFPADs, MFPADs, and the associated expansion parameters $\bar{\beta}_{L,M}(\epsilon,t)$ are generically termed ``anisotropy" parameters. The polar coordinate system $(\theta,\phi)$ is referenced to an experimentally-defined axis in the LF/AF case (usually defined by the laser polarization), and the molecular symmetry axis in the MF (see Fig. \ref{781808}). The spherical harmonic rank and order $(L,M)$ are constrained by experimental factors in the LF/AF, and $n$ is effectively limited by the molecular alignment (which is correlated with the photon-order for gas phase experiments, or conservation of angular momentum in the LF more generally \cite{Yang1948}), but in the MF is defined by the maximum continuum angular momentum $n=l_{max}$ imparted by the scattering event \cite{Dill1976}. 
% VM: \textbf{Is the largest value of L necessarily even? I guess maybe so.} PH: yes, has to be from the 3js, i.e. always have Lmax = lmax + l'max = 2lmax.

For basic cases these limits may be low: for instance, a simple 1-photon photoionization event ($n=1$) from an isotropic ensemble (zero net ensemble angular momentum) defines $L_{max}=2$; for cylindrically symmetric cases (i.e. $D_{\infty h}$ symmetry) $M=0$ only. For MF cases, $l_{max}=4$ is often given as a reasonable rule-of-thumb for the continuum - hence $L_{max}=8$ - although in practice higher-$l$ may be populated. For a realistic example see Sect. \ref{sec:bootstrapping}, and ref. \cite{hockett2018QMP1} for more discussion and complex examples.

A broad conceptual overview for a time-dependent measurement scheme and associated observables is illustrated in Fig. \ref{781808}; although the figure shows a specific experimental scheme, the concepts are general. Note, in particular that the LF measurements involve averaging over an ensemble of molecules with different orientations, leading to averaging over the molecular frame observables, which are highly structured. Compare, in particular, the full MFPADs ($I(\theta,\phi)$ shown in the bottom left panel, with the relatively unstructured - but time-dependent - LFPADs ($\bar{I}(\theta,t)$) shown in the bottom right panel. In this particular example, each time-dependent measurement involves averaging over a different alignment of the ensemble, and represent a rich dataset for retrieving matrix elements and reconstruction of the MFPADs. In cases - such as this example - where the time-dependence is purely geometric, and is separable from the ionization matrix elements, the total information content can be broadly viewed as the number of sets of $\{L,M\}$ at a given $\epsilon$.

% [Following is general-ish, but also quite similar to Sect. 4.1 - should make a more careful separation? Would make sense to have some key eqns. here, and elaborate in Sect. 4.]

% Underlying the observable is the photoelectron continuum wavefunction $\Psi_{e}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{k}})$, prepared via photoionization, and assumed herein to be a 1-photon dipolar photoionization event. The photoelectron momentum vector is denoted generally by $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{k}}$, in the MF. %, which can be regarded as loosely interchangable with an $(\epsilon,\theta,\phi)$ spherical polar coordinate system in the MF. 
% The ionization matrix elements associated with this transition %\textbf{provide the set of quantum amplitudes} 
% provide the set of quantum amplitudes completely defining the final continuum scattering state,
% \begin{equation}
% \left|\Psi_c\right> = \sum{\int{\left|\Psi_{+};\bf{k}\right>\left<\Psi_{+};\mathbf{k}|\Psi_c\right> d\bf{k}}},
% \label{eq:cstate}
% \end{equation}
% % \textbf{where the sum is over states of the molecular ion $\left|\Psi_{+}\right>$. The number of these accessed depends on the nature of the ionizing pulse.} 
% where the sum is over states of the molecular ion $\left|\Psi_{+}\right>$. The number of these accessed depends on the nature of the ionizing pulse. Importantly, the observables are sensitive to the magnitudes and phases of these matrix elements. The ionization dipole matrix elements can be separated into radial (energy-dependent) and geometric (analytical) parts, and the former can be written generally as:

% \begin{equation}
% \left<\Psi_{+};\mathbf{k}|\Psi_c\right> \equiv r_{k,l,m}=\langle\Psi_{+};\,\psi_{l,m}(k)|\hat{\mathbf{\mu}}.\boldsymbol{\mathbf{E}}|\Psi_{i}\rangle
% \label{eq:r-kllam}
% \end{equation}

% Where the notation implies a perturbative photoionization event from an initial state $i$ to a particular ion plus electron state following absorption of a photon $h\nu$, % $|\Psi_{i}\rangle\stackrel{h\nu}{\rightarrow}|\Psi_{+};\,\Psi_{e}(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{k}})\rangle$, 
% $|\Psi_{i}\rangle+h\nu{\rightarrow}|\Psi_{+};\boldsymbol{\mathbf{k}}\rangle$, and the photoelectron wavefunction is expressed as a set of ``partial waves", with angular momentum components $(l,m)$ (note lower case notation for the partial wave components). Provided that the analytical solutions are known, knowledge of the radial matrix elements $r_{k,l,m}$ at a given $(\epsilon,t)$ thus equates to a full description of the system (and, hence, the observables). 
% %\textbf{The photoelectron angular distribution (PAD) at a given $(\epsilon,t)$ can then be determined by the squared projection of $\left|\Psi_c\right>$ onto a specific state $\left|\Psi_{+};\bf{k}\right>$, and therefore the amplitudes in Eq.~\ref{eq:r-kllam} which then also determine the observable anisotropy parameters $\beta_{L,M}(\epsilon,t)$. If a number of ionic states are accessed, each state is treated independently.}

Typically, for reconstruction experiments, a given measurement will be selected to simplify this as much as possible by, e.g., populating only a single ionic state (or states for which the corresponding observables are experimentally energetically-resolvable), and with a bandwidth $d\bf{k}$ which is small enough such that the matrix elements can be assumed constant.
% % If a number of ionic states are accessed, each state is treated independently. [THIS IS MISLEADING, possibly - it's dependent on too many things!]
% %by knowledge of the anisotropy parameters $\beta_{L,M}(\epsilon,t)$, and does not necessarily require knowledge of the matrix elements.

% The difficulty in reconstruction in general arises from the fact that there are typically many component partial waves (matrix elements) for even a simple system, and that determination of both magnitudes and phases is required. Hence this can be viewed as a form of quantum tomography, or a specific class of (quantum) phase-retrieval problems. In terms of the MF observable, these properties result in a quantity that may be highly structured and, hence, is (in general) particularly susceptible to orientational averaging. Furthermore, it may be particularly sensitive to averaging over other DOFs (e.g. vibronic states) and/or molecular dynamics, due to inherent sensitivity of the scattering process to molecular structure. Whilst a number of direct and indirect techniques have been used to obtain the relevant MF observables and/or dipole matrix elements, many outstanding questions remain, and this is an ongoing, interesting and challenging area of research \cite{hockett2018QuantumMetrologyPhotoelectrons,hockett2018QuantumMetrologyPhotoelectronsa}.
