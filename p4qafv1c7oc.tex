\section{Reconstruction examples & recent developments in time-domain measurements}

In this section/the remainder of the manuscript, reconstruction of MFPADs from time-domain measurements are considered using two methodologies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item "Bootstrapping" to the MF bootstrapping to the molecular frame
\item Matrix reconstruction
\end{enumerate}
