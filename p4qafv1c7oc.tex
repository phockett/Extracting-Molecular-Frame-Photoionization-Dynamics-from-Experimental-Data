\section{Reconstruction examples & recent developments in time-domain measurements}

In this section/the remainder of the manuscript, reconstruction of MFPADs from time-domain measurements are considered using two methodologies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item "Bootstrapping" to the MF \cite{hockett2018QMP1,hockett2018QMP2,marceau2017MolecularFrameReconstruction}
\item Matrix reconstruction with Moore-Penrose inversion \cite{gregory2021MolecularFramePhotoelectron}
\end{enumerate}

The techniques are closely related, but differ in the "directness" of the reconstruction: in the former case, the aim is full matrix element retrieval, and the MFPADs can then be computed from these "complete" results; in the latter the MFPADs are determined via a transformation matrix, and full matrix element retrieval is not necessary.
