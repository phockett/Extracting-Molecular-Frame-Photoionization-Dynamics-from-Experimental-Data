[ePSproc example walk-through? Or notebooks from QM book?]

The core physics of photoionization has been covered extensively in the literature, and only a very brief overview is provided here; the reader is referred to the literature listed at the end of this section for further details.

Photoionization describes the coupling of an initial state of the system to a final state, coupled by an electric field
comprised of the (system minus electron)  In essence, photoionization involves two key components: (1) the structure of the continuum (free electron) wavefunction
