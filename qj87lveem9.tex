\subsection{Photoionization dynamics} 
[ePSproc example walk-through? Or notebooks from QM book?]

The core physics of photoionization has been covered extensively in the literature, and only a very brief overview is provided here; the reader is referred to the literature listed at the end of this section for further details.

Photoionization describes the coupling of an initial state of the system to a final state (photoion(s) plus free photoelectron(s)), coupled by an electric field/photon. Very generically, this can be written as a matrix element $\langle\Psi_i|\hat{\Gamma}(E)|\Psi_f\rangle$, where $\hat{\Gamma}(E)$ defines the light-matter coupling operator (depending on the electric field $E$), and $\Psi_i$, $\Psi_f$ the total wavefunctions of the initial and final states respectively. 

There are many flavours of this fundamental light-matter interaction, depending on system and coupling; the discussion here is confined initially to the simplest case of single-photon absorption, in the weak field, dipole regime, resulting in a single photoelectron. As a first approximation, this can usually be treated as a single active electron problem, in which the system

In essence, photoionization in this limit can typically be considered in terms of three key components: (1) the initial (ionizing) state wavefunction, (2) the structure of the continuum (free electron) wavefunction, (3) the dipole matrix elements coupling these wavefunctions.
