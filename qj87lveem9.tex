\subsection{Photoionization dynamics} 
[ePSproc example walk-through? Or notebooks from QM book?]

The core physics of photoionization has been covered extensively in the literature, and only a very brief overview is provided here; the reader is referred to the literature listed at the end of this section for further details.

In essence, photoionization involves two key components, (1)
