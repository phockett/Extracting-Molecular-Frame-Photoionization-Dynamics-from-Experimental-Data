\subsubsection{Bootstrapping basics: density matrix representation}

An alternative test of fidelity can be investigated via a density matrix representation of the results, this is shown in Fig. \ref{998904}. Overall the agreement is good for the real values (righthand column of Fig. \ref{998904}), as expected from the values in Table \ref{tab:matE}, and the differences (bottom row) are generally $<10~\%$. However, for the imaginary values (middle column) the loss of the sign of the phases leads to larger differences in the off-diagonal density matrix elements, and this is also reflected in larger differences in the absolute value plots.
