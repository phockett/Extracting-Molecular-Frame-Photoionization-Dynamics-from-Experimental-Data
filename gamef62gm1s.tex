\subsubsection{Bootstrapping basics: density matrix representation}

An alternative test of fidelity can be investigated via a density matrix representation of the results, this is shown in Fig. \ref{998904}. Overall the agreement is good for the real values (righthand column of Fig. \ref{998904}), as expected from the values in Table \ref{tab:matE}, and the differences (bottom)
