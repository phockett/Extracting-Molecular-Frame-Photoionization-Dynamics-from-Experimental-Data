<div>Further control can be gained via a single, or sequence of, N-photon transitions, or strong-field mediated techniques. Of the latter, adiabatic and non-adiabatic alignment methods are particularly powerful, and make use of a strong, slowly-varying or impulsive laser field respectively. (Here the "slow" and "impulsive" time-scales are defined in relation to molecular rotations, roughly on the ps time-scale, with ns and fs laser fields corresponding to the typical slow and fast control fields.) In the former case, the molecular axis, or axes, will gradually align along the electric-field vector(s) while the field is present; in the latter a broad rotational wavepacket can be created, initiating complex rotational dynamics including field-free revivals of ensemble alignment. Both techniques are powerful, but multiple laser fields are typically required in order to control more than one molecular axis, leading to relatively complex experimental requirements. The absolute degree of alignment obtained in a given case is also dependent on a number of intrinsic and experimental properties, including the molecular polarisability tensor, rotational temperature and separability of the rotational degrees of freedom from other DOFs (loosely speaking, this can be considered as the stiffness of the molecule). Therefore, although general in principle, in practice not all molecular targets are amenable to&nbsp;<i>good</i> alignment. Whilst gas phase alignment experiments can become rather complex, multi-pulse affairs, they are increasingly popular in the AMO community for a number of possible reasons - conceptually and experimentally, they are a relatively tractable extension to existing techniques, they are interesting experiments in their own right, and, practically, they are usually feasible with existing high-power pulsed laser sources in the ns to fs regime.</div><div>An alternative, very different, technique of orientational control is via embedding the target species in a matrix, or via deposition on a surface, which defines a spatial orientation. This approach has been taken by the surface science community, in particular in ARPES and SERS studies. In these techniques, molecular orientation is well-defined, but at the expense of interactions with the bulk. Such techniques are readily applied to a range of targets using existing experimental apparatus combined with suitably-prepared surfaces. Of particular note in this regard is SERS work making use of functionalised nano-particles for "single molecule" fluorescence studies. [more to say on ARPES?]</div><div>[Anything on cold molecules?]</div><div>The second category covers methodologies which make use of experimental information to reconstruct, post-facto, molecular alignment at the time of a light-matter interaction. This usually involves making a "kinematically complete" class of measurement, which provides the full energy or momentum partitioning of the products of a light-matter interaction. In order for the alignment of a given axis to be defined in this case, there must be clear energy partitioning along it - typically dissociation is required. A trivial example is the dissociation of a diatomic molecule, in this case measuring the momentum of just one product atom/ion will enable the original orientation of the molecule to be determined. Combined with measurement of an electron, in coincidence, the MF photoelectron distribution can be recovered from a set of such measurements. Further extensions to such a measurement can probe additional dynamics in the MF, for instance electron-electron correlation effects in double ionization or bond-length dependence of the observable when recoil energy of the ion is measured [ref. multiple early 2000 Dorner papers].</div><div>For larger molecules this becomes more complicated, and additionally requires that axial-recoil conditions are fulfilled (i.e. energy is not partitioned into other DOFs during dissociation). Such measurements are, therefore, well-suited to diatomics, and small polyatomics, and light-matter interactions involving core-ionization(s) events. For valence studies these techniques are less directly applicable, since dissociative events are less common (and may be slow/complex), although potentially can be applied in Coulomb-explosion imaging type scenarios[refs...?].</div><div>Another caveat for this class of measurement is the requirement for coincidence (or covariance) data collection, which usually limits count rates significantly, as well as the total number of products which may be feasibly measured [4...5...?]. Presumably for these various reasons, these experiments have typically been performed at synchrotons with high repetition rates (high KHz, MHz) and at hard photon energies - although laser-based experiments are also relatively common. [somethign about detector tech...?]</div><div>[COLTRIMS, x-ray diffraction]</div><div>A final note on experimental methods is the possibilities afforded by technological (rather than conceptual) developments. Naturally, the techniques above rely on a certain degree of experimental and technological sophistication, and this generally increases over time. Examples, in this context, are the development of, and gradual improvements in, particle imaging detectors. Such progress allows for more sophisticated experiments with, e.g. multi-particle coincidence detection, higher detection rates, energy-multiplexed measurements and so on. In short, the experimental dimensionality or information content can be increased.</div><h2 data-label="506808" class="ltx_title_subsection">Analysis methodologies</h2><h1 data-label="533755" class="ltx_title_section">Literature review</h1><div>[May be integrated above?]</div><h1>Recent developments</h1><h1 data-label="356458" class="ltx_title_section">Outlook</h1><h1 data-label="748985" class="ltx_title_section">Resources</h1>
