This is, of course, a topic long at the heart of physical chemistry, and particularly spectroscopy, which typically aims to determine atomic and molecular properties with high precision; the “inverse” problem of transforming ab initio (computational) MF results to the LF, in order to compare with experimental measurements, also has a long and storied history. In both cases the issue is, in the general case, one of complexity and averaging over unobserved quantities; furthermore, in many cases, certain properties may be poorly understood, may fundamentally obscure other properties of interest, and/or may not be readily computed - these issues are particularly relevant for the specific case of photoionization dynamics, which is an inherently complicated scattering problem, and may be strongly coupled to other molecular properties. </div><div><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="188893"></span></div><div></div>
