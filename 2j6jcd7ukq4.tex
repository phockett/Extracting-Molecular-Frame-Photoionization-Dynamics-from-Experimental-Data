\subsubsection{Retrieval \& reconstruction techniques}

Very generally, the problem of retrieval can be considered in terms of completeness, i.e. the degree to which the full quantum state of the system is know. In photoionization, ``complete" experiments, in which the full system wavefunction (matrix elements), denote the class of measurements in which full matrix elements are 

Following the tensor notation presented ab

Of particular note in the following is the phase-sensitive nature of the observables, hence PADs can also be considered as angular interferograms. (Cf. FROG, tomography)
