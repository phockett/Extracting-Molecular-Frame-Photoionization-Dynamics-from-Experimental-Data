\subsubsection{Retrieval \& reconstruction techniques}

% Very generally, the problem of retrieval can be considered in terms of completeness, i.e. the degree to which the full quantum state of the system is know. In photoionization, ``complete" experiments, in which the full system wavefunction (matrix elements), denote the class of measurements in which full matrix element retrieval is the goal, as distinct from measurements which aim at specific observables
% This is currently briefly in Sect. 3.1, but probably should be expanded!

Following the tensor notation presented above, a ``complete" photoionization experiment can be characterized as recovery of the matrix elements $I^{\zeta}(\epsilon)$ from the experimental measurements or, equivalently, the density matrix $\mathbf{\rho}^{\zeta\zeta'}$. This may be possible provided the channel functions are known, and the information content of the measurements is sufficient. (Note here that the time-independent) 

Of particular note in the following is the phase-sensitive nature of the observables, hence PADs can also be considered as angular interferograms. (Cf. FROG, tomography)
