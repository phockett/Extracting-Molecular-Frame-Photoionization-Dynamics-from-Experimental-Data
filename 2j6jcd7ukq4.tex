\subsubsection{Retrieval \& reconstruction techniques}

% Very generally, the problem of retrieval can be considered in terms of completeness, i.e. the degree to which the full quantum state of the system is know. In photoionization, ``complete" experiments, in which the full system wavefunction (matrix elements), denote the class of measurements in which full matrix element retrieval is the goal, as distinct from measurements which aim at specific observables
% This is currently briefly in Sect. 3.1, but probably should be expanded!

Following the tensor notation presented above, a ``complete" photoionization experiment can be characterized as recovery of the matrix elements $I^{\zeta}(\epsilon)$ from the experimental measurements or, equivalently, the density matrix $\mathbf{\rho}^{\zeta\zeta'}$. (For further discussion, see refs. \cite{Reid2003,kleinpoppen2013perfect,hockett2018QMP1}.) This may be possible provided the channel functions are known, and the information content of the measurements is sufficient. (Note here that the matrix elements are assumed to be time-independent, although that may not be the case for the most complicated examples including vibronic dynamics \cite{hockett2018QMP2}.) 

Of particular import here is the phase-sensitive nature of the observables, which is required in order to obtain partial wave phase information - hence PADs can also be considered as angular interferograms, and reconstruction can be considered conceptually similar to other phase-retrieval problems, e.g. optical field recovery with techniques such as FROG \cite{trebino2000FrequencyResolvedOpticalGating}, and general quantum tomography \cite{MauroDAriano2003}. The nature of the problem suggests that a fitting approach can work, in general, provided that the channel
