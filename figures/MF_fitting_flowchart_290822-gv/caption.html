<div data-label="671760">    MF matrix element retrieval protocol outline. Filled shapes indicate (upper) required inputs to the fitting stages (experimental measurements and geometric parameters), (lower) the final outputs (matrix elements).&nbsp; &nbsp; Note that this is essentially identical to the level 2 bootstrapping protocol (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{807606}</span>), except with MF observables as the input. This can also be viewed as a generic model protocol, subject to the given set of measurements and associated channel functions.</div>
