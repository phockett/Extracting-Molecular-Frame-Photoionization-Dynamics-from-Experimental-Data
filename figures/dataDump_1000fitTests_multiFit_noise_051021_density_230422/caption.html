<div data-label="998904">Density matrix representations for the continuum. (top row) From reference matrix elements, (middle row) from the retrieved matrix elements, (bottom row) differences. Each row shows the elements for the (imag)inary and real components. Density matrix values (complex) were renormalised to unity by the maximum before plotting (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(|1,0,0\rangle \langle1,0,0|\)</span>&nbsp;element), and these representations show the case for unsigned phases; note also the rescaled colourmap for the difference plots.&nbsp;</div>
