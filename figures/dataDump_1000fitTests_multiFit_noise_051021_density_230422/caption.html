<div data-label="998904">Density matrix representations for (top row) original matrix elements, (middle row) the retrieved matrix elements, (bottom row) differences. Each row shows the elements for (i)maginary and (r)eal components. Values are normalised to the maximum; Note the rescaled colourmap for the difference plots. TODO: fix labels. Fix differences - not currently correct for abs case? Overall metrics/better way to show differences?</div>
