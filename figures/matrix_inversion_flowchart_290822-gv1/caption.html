<div data-label="731792">    Matrix inversion protocol outline. Filled shapes indicate (upper) required inputs to the fitting stages (experimental measurements, trial ADMs, and geometric parameters), (lower) the final outputs (ADMs, and MF observables), matrix elements may also be obtained via further treatment of the MF observables (Sect.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{sec:recon-from-MFPADs}</span>).&nbsp; &nbsp; Note that the ADM retrieval step is the same as the level 1 bootstrapping stage (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{807606}</span>).</div>
