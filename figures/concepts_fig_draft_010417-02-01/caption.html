<div data-label="781808">Conceptual outline for retrieval of MF properties for ``bootstrapping to the MF", via a set of time-resolved measurements and suitable post-processing scheme. In the LF, a set of laser pulses creates and probes an aligned distribution of molecules, and photoelectron images are measured. The experimental data is analyzed through a multi-step ``bootstrap" protocol to obtain matrix elements, which constitute a complete description of the photoionization event. These can further be used to obtain MF observables, for any polarization geometry. Note the coordinates show will be used throughout the manuscript, with the LF z-axis defined relative to the laser field (<b>E</b>) polarization, and the MF defined with the molecular axis aligned along the z-axis (and polarization geometries for the laser field (<b>E</b>) referenced to this axis).&nbsp;</div>
