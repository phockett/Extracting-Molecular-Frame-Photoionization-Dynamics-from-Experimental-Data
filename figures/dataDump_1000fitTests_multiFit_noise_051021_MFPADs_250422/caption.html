<div data-label="454268">Reconstructed MFPADs for N2. Columns show results for polarization geometries&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\((z,x,y,d)\)</span> and rows the results for difference sets of matrix elements: retrieved mean case, phase-corrected case, reference (computational) results and difference between phase-correct and reference case. Note the colour-scale is rescaled per row, thus emphasizing the changes in form of the MFPADs (but obfuscating relative magnitudes), particularly for the difference case. See main text for further details.</div>
