<div data-label="494229">Statistics for the 349 best fit results (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\chi^2 &lt; 2.3 \times 10^{-4}\)</span>). Plots show magnitudes (top) and phase (bottom) parameters, labelled by&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\((l,m)\)</span>, with spread proportional to the number of results and colour-mapped by&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\chi^2\)</span> . Note the clustering by&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\chi^2\)</span>, where each cluster constitutes a viable set of matrix elements, and the lack of variation for the <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(|1,-1\rangle\)</span> phase, which was fi as a reference</div>
