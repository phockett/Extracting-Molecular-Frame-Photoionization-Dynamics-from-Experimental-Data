<div data-label="494229">Statistics for the 349 best fit results (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\bar{\chi}^2 &lt; 2.3 \times 10^{-4}\)</span>). Plots show magnitudes (top) and phase (bottom) parameters, labelled by&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\((l,m)\)</span>, with spread proportional to the number of results and colour-mapped by&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\bar{\chi}^2\)</span> . Note the clustering by&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\bar{\chi}^2\)</span>, where each cluster constitutes a viable set of matrix elements (particularly in&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\phi_{3,\pm1}\)</span> terms) , and the lack of variation for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\phi_{1,-1}\)</span>, which was fixed as a reference.</div>
