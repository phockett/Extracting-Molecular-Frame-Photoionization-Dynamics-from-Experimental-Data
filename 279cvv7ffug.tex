\section{Appendix A - Further reading\label{sec:Appendix-A}}

The following sections provide further reading on specific topics for interested readers. In line with the aims of this manuscript, these sections are (very) far from comprehensive, but aim to provide a jumping-off point for the topics; it is hoped that a more comprehensive, crowd-sourced and ongoing listing will be generated via the \href{https://www.zotero.org/groups/4733878/molecular_frame_pads_measurements_and_reconstruction}{\textit{``Molecular Frame PADs Measurements and Reconstruction"}} online bibliography on Zotero \cite{hockettZoteroGroupsMolecular}.

\subsection{MF experimental literature sample\label{appendix:MF-expt}}

Reviews covering this class of experiment can be found in  \cite{Yagishita2005,Reid2012,dowek2012PhotoionizationDynamicsPhotoemission,Yagishita2015, jahnke2022PhotoelectronDiffraction, dowek2022TrendsAngleresolvedMolecular}; some (representative) examples from the literature include:

\begin{itemize}
\item MFPADs for N2 core ionization \cite{Shigemasa1995}
\item MFPADs from various diatomics with coincidence velocity-map imaging \cite{Eland2000} \cite{Hikosaka2000}
\item MFPADs from CO K-shell photoionization \cite{motoki2000KshellPhotoionizationCO} and matrix element retrieval \cite{Cherepkov2000}.
\item MFPADs and matrix element retrieval for N2 \cite{Gessner2002a}
\item MFPADs and matrix element retrieval for NO inner-valence ionization \cite{Lucchese2002,Lebech2003} (this makes use of a general $F_{LN}(\theta_e)$ parametrized treatment of the MFPADs (see also ref. \cite{Lafosse2002}), which provides a suitable reduction method for experimental data analysis for RF and MFPADs, and the potential for matrix element retrieval, in a somewhat similar manner to the tensor approach discussed herein). % TO consider futher - just a reparametrization of the usual stuff, plus some special cases.
% \item MFPADs review \cite{Yagishita2005} % \cite{Cherepkov2005, Yagishita2005}
\item NO2 RFPADs \cite{Toffoli2007}.
\item NO MFPADs (1s channels) \cite{Li2007}.
\item Interference and entanglement in H2 double ionization in the MF \cite{Akoury2007}.
\item General discussion of multi-particle imaging with COLTRIMS \cite{Trinter2012a}.
\item Imaging methane MFPADs with electron-ion-ion coincidences \cite{Williams2012, Williams2012a}.
\item MFPADs from naphthalene ($C_{10}H_{8}$) via alignment and tomographic imaging \cite{Maurer2012}.
\item MFPADs from H2 and D2 at ~30eV photon energies (HHG source) \cite{Billaud2012a}.
\item MFPADs via alignment for Auger-Meitner electrons \cite{Cryan2010,Cryan2012a}.

\item MFPADs from core ionization of carbon tetrafluoride ($CF_4$), ethane ($C_2H_6$) and 1,1-difluoroethylene ($C_2 H_2 F_2$)\cite{Menssen2016}.

% UPDATED 12/07/22, and Zotero folders updated.
% LIST IN PROGRESS 03/09/21 
% NOTE: doesn't currently include any dynamical cases.
% TO CONSIDER: move to end as supplementals, and link to Zotero library for "ongoing" version?
