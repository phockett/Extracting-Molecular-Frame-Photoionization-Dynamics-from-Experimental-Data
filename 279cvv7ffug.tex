\section{Appendix\label{sec:resources}}

The following sections provide further reading on specific topics for interested readers. In line with the aims of this manuscript, these sections are (very) far from comprehensive, but aim to provide a jumping-off point for the topics; it is hoped that a more comprehensive, crowd-sourced, listing will be generated via the online bibliography.

\subsection{MF experimental literature sample\label{appendix:MF-expt}}

Reviews covering this class of experiment can be found in  \cite{Yagishita2005,Reid2012,dowek2012PhotoionizationDynamicsPhotoemission,Yagishita2015}; some (representative) examples from the literature include:

\begin{itemize}
\item MFPADs for N2 core ionization \cite{Shigemasa1995}
\item MFPADs from various diatomics with coincidence velocity-map imaging \cite{Eland2000} \cite{Hikosaka2000}
\item MFPADs from CO K-shell photoionization \cite{motoki2000KshellPhotoionizationCO}
\item NO2 RFPADs \cite{Toffoli2007}
\item NO MFPADs (1s channels) \cite{Li2007}
\item Interference and entanglement in H2 double ionization in the MF \cite{Akoury2007}
\item MFPADs from H2 and D2 at ~30eV photon energies (HHG source) \cite{Billaud2012a}
\item MFPADs for Auger-Meitner electrons \cite{Cryan2010,Cryan2012a}

\item MFPADs from core ionization of carbon tetrafluoride (CF4), ethane (C2H6) and 1,1-difluoroethylene (C2H2F2)\cite{Menssen2016}
\end{itemize}
